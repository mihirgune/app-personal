612,what is it most similar to,bat with the highest being 96 % identity
613,how many people were affected as of 10 2020,greater than 40000
614,how is the sarscov2 to,as disease discovered in 2019
615,how much similarity the sarscov2 genome sequence with,∼ 80 % identity with
616,what similarity human and palm civet share,998 % homology with a total of 202 across the genome
617,how much is the difference between the human sarscov2 and the bat ratg13cov,greater than 1100
618,why is it highly unlikely that ratg13 is the immediate source of sarscov2,are distributed throughout the genome in a naturally pattern following the evolutionary typical of
619,what are the most revealing that sarscov2 by natural evolution,the absence of a logical targeted pattern in the new viral and a close relative in a wildlife species bat
620,what did the nature medicine paper report,the construction of a chimeric with a bat s gene in the backbone of a that to infect mice and is capable of human
621,why does the claim lack any scientific basis,because of significant divergence in the genetic sequence of this construct with the new sarscov2
622,how was the virus,by serial passage of an infectious clone in the respiratory tract of mice
623,how did the gain elevated replication and lung pathogenesis in aged mice,due to six genetic associated with mouse adaptation
624,why is it likely that ma15 is highly to replicate in human,due to the mouse adaptation
625,why were to be an intermediate host of the capable of spreading to,t was that the s gene from unlike that from human was unable to use human ace2 as a receptor for entry into human
626,what was the finding in 2013,several novel bat were isolated from horseshoe bats and the bat or slcovwiv1 was able to use ace2 from and horseshoe bats for entry
627,why is it that some bat may be able to directly infect human,combined with evolutionary evidence that the bat ace2 gene been positively selected at the same contact as the human ace2 gene for with [
628,what was done to test if an intermediate host may not be necessary and that some bat may be able to directly infect human t,the exact s gene from bat slshc014 was and used to generate a chimeric virus in the mouse ma15 backbone
629,what were the of this test,the resultant slshc014ma15 virus could indeed efficiently use human ace2 and replicate in primary human airway to similar as epidemic of while slshc014ma15 can replicate efficiently in young and aged mouse infection was and less virus antigen was present in the airway epithelium as to ma15 which lethal in aged mice
630,why were with slshc014ma15 chimeric virus were later restricted,as gain of function under the us pause policy
631,why is there no credible evidence to support the claim that the sarscov2 is derived from the chimeric slshc014ma15 virus,upon careful phylogenetic analyses by multiple international the sarscov2 is undoubtedly distinct from slshc014ma15 with 6000 nucleotide across the whole genome
632,what did the that the virus was made by in the lab claim,that sarscov2 sequence in it and was thus likely in the laboratory i
633,what was in a rebuttal paper led by an hiv1 virologist,they used careful analyses to demonstrate that the original claim of multiple into the sarscov2 is not hiv1 specific but random
634,what to the report with initial,because of the many raised by the international community the who made the initial claim have already withdrawn this report
635,what is the difference between evolution and synthetic,evolution is stepwise and gradually over time whereas synthetic would typically use a known backbone and introduce logical or targeted instead of the randomly that are present in naturally isolated such as bat ratg13
636,what is the conclusion of this report,there is currently no credible evidence to support the claim that sarscov2 from a it is more likely that sarscov2 is a in nature between a bat and another in an intermediate animal host
637,what is the conclusion of this report,more are to explore this possibility and resolve the natural origin of sarscov2 we should emphasize that although sarscov2 no evidence of laboratory origin with such great public health must be handled properly in the laboratory and also properly regulated by the scientific community and

738,what are important criteria for vaccine delivery,a vaccine should be inexpensive so that it can be to a large population at minimal cost
739,what are important criteria for vaccine delivery,safety is a major concern as even a low level of toxicity is unacceptable
740,what are important criteria for vaccine delivery,cellular and humoral immune to the antigen must be induced following administration of these preferably with a single dose
741,what when a recipient of a vaccine immune response to the delivery vector,considering a vector such as salmonella if a host previously been infected there will exist robust b and t memory and as such when a vaccination is an anamnestic response to the salmonella will be induced
742,what is the effect of host immune response to the delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination,for the existence of immunity to the vector will restrict delivery of the virus into thereby effectively reducing the dose of the antigen again this might be to result in a reduction in the antigenicity of the antigen
743,what is the effect of host immune response to the delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination,theoretically reduce the exposure of the heterologous antigen to the immune system as the vector is rapidly
744,what is an example of the effect of immunity to the delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination,mice that had been with salmonella alone and then with salmonella induced much lower than mice that had not been this strongly that prior immunological immunity to the vector can seriously dampen subsequent humoral
745,what is the effect of host immune response to viral delivery in the efficacy of vaccination,immunity is a major obstacle of many such as ad 5 or herpes simplex virus type 1 where the rate of to these is very high of the us population respectively ]
746,what is the effect of host immune response to the viral delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination,may impede the induction of immune to the as they may reduce the dose and time of exposure of the target to the
747,what is the effect of host immune response to the delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination,in a clinical trial of an ad 5 based hiv1 vaccine the a lack of efficacy and to increase the risk of hiv1 infection in vaccine who had to adhu5
748,what are to avoid the effect vector immunity on the efficacy of vaccination,the use of derived from nonhuman human of rare heterologous homologous and removing key on the surface of viral capsid
749,what are to avoid the effect of vector immune response on the efficacy of vaccination,the inhibitory effect of immunity can also be by the ad vector inside dendritic in addition mucosal vaccination or administration of higher vaccine can overcome immunity
750,how does immunity to viral delivery vector reduce the immune response to vaccine,this is because will induce antibody on the first dose and in subsequent this antibody will limit the number of therefore limiting the this is particularly a problem with a common viral vector such as ad where a large proportion of the population will have immunological memory against common
751,how can for which host immunity be used differently to increase the efficacy of vaccination,it will be possible to utilize such only by from alternative it may be that a vector such as immunity against vaccine influenza virus with the ability to easily develop will be useful in this context in addition immunological memory in the form of antibody certainly an important role in the early uptake of salmonella by and this may be beneficial as the live bacterial vector used for delivery in responsible for their survival in the animal host this not only their ability to cause disease making them safe live but also the number of the presence of should mean a higher level of bacterial uptake leading to higher presentation to the immune system and therefore a better immune response

1260,what avian infectious bronchitis,infectious bronchitis virus
1261,what the two chicken used in this study,serum concentration of
1262,which organ was used for the,spleen
1263,what is to elucidate zoonotic emergence,a mechanistic understanding of the impact of bats ’ virus hosting uniquely constitutive immune on viral dynamics
1264,what is the conclusion of this report,immune limit cellular morbidity which can facilitate the establishment of persistent that have with bat immune will likely cause enhanced virulence following emergence into secondary with immune that diverge from those unique to bats
1265,why have bats received attention in recent,for their role as reservoir for viral rabies and related and and and
1266,what difference bats demonstrate to most,no obvious disease upon infection with that are highly virulent in nonvolant but may instead support as persistent rather than transient
1267,what suite of do bats have to limit viral load,host receptor sequence for some and constitutive expression of the antiviral
1268,how are mammalian typically antiviral,the presence of viral or in the cytoplasm of mammalian will induce secretion of type i which promote expression and translation of in neighboring
1269,in nonflying what what would be by expression upon viral infection,widespread inflammation and concomitant upon viral infection
1270,what do the bats do instead,bats support unique to combat inflammation
1271,why may the bats have this unique adaptation,to mitigate metabolic damage induced during flight
1272,why was the field of virus dynamics,to describe the mechanistic of of viral load by in chronic phase with who to produce and clear virus at equivalent
1273,how are bats connected to fatal viral,bats are natural for that have some of the highest fatality of any that people acquire from wild rabies and the
1274,what is an example of antiviral defense in bats,some bats have an antiviral immune response the pathway perpetually switched on
1275,what would be by this in most other,harmful inflammation
1276,how are bats different,bats however have that protect them from such harm include the loss of certain that normally promote inflammation
1277,what bat species were,the black flying fox in which the pathway is always on and another the fruit bat in which this pathway is only during an infection
1278,what was the conclusion of the study,in both bat species the antiviral were by the virus spreading more quickly from cell to cell this that bat immune may drive the evolution of faster and while bats are well from the harmful effects of their own prolific other like are not
1279,what would be the benefit of learning more about bat ' s and how they drive virus evolution,help develop better ways to predict prevent or limit the spread of from bats to
1280,which are and therefore limited in antiviral capacity,demonstrate idiosyncratic induced upon viral challenge
1281,what demonstrate idiosyncratic response,roni71
1282,which express constitutive,pakit01 cell
1283,how were the spread of across tissue tracked via inverted fluorescence microscopy,because plaque restrict viral transmission in cellular space
1284,how were the spread of tracked,for each infection trial we and for up to 200 of or until total monolayer destruction resulting and a time series of the proportion of plate space across the duration of each trial we used generalized additive to infer the time course of all cell culture and construct the to which we eventually fit our mechanistic transmission model for each cell
1285,how was the modeling carried out,an innovative combination of in experimentation and modeling to explore the impact of unique bat immunity on virus dynamics
1286,what was the finding in this study,that bat cell a signature of enhanced immune response of either constitutive or induced form which for establishment of rapid virus transmission
1287,what the,by both bifurcation analysis of our mean field theoretical model as well as fitting of this model to viral infection time series established in bat cell culture
1288,what was additionally,the antiviral state induced by the pathway live from mortality in tissue culture resulting in in of extended duration that enhance the probability of a persistent infection
1289,what do the suggest,that in bat possessing enhanced could achieve more rapid transmission without causing pathology to their such would likely generate extreme virulence upon to similar immune to bats
1290,what was the methodology for this study,we first a novel theoretical model the effects of unique bat immunity then undertook bifurcation analysis of the model ' s equilibrium under immune absent induced and constitutive we considered a cell line to be constitutively immune if possessing any number of antiviral at equilibrium but the extent of constitutive immunity to vary across the parameter range for the constitutive rate of antiviral acquisition
1291,what was in the equation for r 0,invasion threshold is elevated at high of constitutive antiviral acquisition
1292,what is a conclusion of the modeling,constitutive immune can thus prohibit pathogen invasion while induced by definition can only control
1293,what is a conclusion of the study,regardless of mechanism antiviral appear to play a key role in longer term or persistent by susceptible from rapid infection and concomitant cell death
1294,what do to on pakit01 suggest,that the constitutive expression characteristic of p may represent more of a constitutive immune priming process than a perpetual functional antiviral defense
1295,what do the indicate,enhanced immune in bat may promote elevated virus replication prior to emergence
1296,what is in this study,general to study viral dynamics which suggest that persistence is by robust antiviral characteristic of bat immune
1297,what is a conclusion of this study,which evolve rapid replication under these robust antiviral may pose the hazard for pathogen emergence into with immune that differ from those unique to bats

1573,what is the lower airway the site of,inflammation in most chronic airway inflammatory
1574,where is the the first point of contact with of exacerbation,the upper airway
1575,what is the focus of this review,recent of viral interaction with the upper airway
1576,what is by the,how viral induced to the upper airway may contribute to chronic airway inflammatory disease to provide a unified elucidation of the potential exacerbation from predominantly upper airway
1577,before linking respiratory what was linked to acute,despite being a major cause of exacerbation linking respiratory to acute only start to emerge in the late 1950s with bacterial previously considered as the likely culprit for acute exacerbation
1578,what did the of technology lead to,were during acute and their role in the late 1980s
1579,what are the predominant linked to airway inflammatory,and respiratory syncytial virus
1580,what other are in acute but to a much lesser extent,virus influenza virus and
1581,what other have been recently as to acute,human certain a specific strain evd68 human and herpes simplex virus
1582,what are the common feature of these share,they can infect both the upper lower airway further increasing the inflammatory in the diseased airway
1583,where do the respiratory primarily infect and replicate,within airway epithelial
1584,what during the replication process,the release antiviral and that alter local airway inflammation and airway niche
1585,what does the inflammation lead to in healthy,to type 1 inflammatory of activation of an antiviral state and infiltration of antiviral effector this eventually in the resolution of the inflammatory response and clearance of the viral infection
1586,how may the be different in a chronically inflamed airway,the against the virus may be or aberrant causing sustained inflammation and erroneous infiltration resulting in the exacerbation of their this is usually further by the susceptibility of chronic airway inflammatory disease toward viral respiratory thereby increasing the frequency of exacerbation as a whole
1587,what will the review focus on,and the current known of exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory as well as linking the different viral infection pathogenesis to elucidate other potential ways the infection can exacerbate the disease
1588,how will this review serve,to provide further understanding of viral induced exacerbation to identify potential and pathogenesis that may be targeted as supplementary care for management and prevention of exacerbation
1589,why is this approach significant,due to the current scarcity of antiviral for the management of
1590,what upon infection,evoke an inflammatory response as a of counteracting the infection
1591,how does the infected airway cell respond,generally infected airway epithelial release type i and type and such as il6 il8 il12 macrophage inflammatory protein 1α and monocyte chemotactic protein 1
1592,what does the epithelial cause,enable infiltration of innate immune and of professional antigen that will then in turn release specific to facilitate viral and clearance type il2 il4 il5 il9 and il12
1593,what is the effect of these,these heighten local inflammation and the infiltration of and the inflammation in turn the of airway
1594,what additional effects are in with asthma and with with nasal polyp,viral such as and promote a type 2biased immune response this the basal type 2 inflammation resulting in a greater release of il4 il5 il13 and and a further increase in eosinophilia a key pathological driver of asthma and
1595,what is the result of eosinophilia,the classical of disease and may further lead to due to breathing
1596,what are the effects for with and with without nasal polyp,are more neutrophilic in nature due to the expression of such as cxcl9 cxcl10 and cxcl11 the pathology of these airway is by airway due to the presence of such as matrix from viral in such will then cause increase neutrophilic activation worsening the and airway in the airway thereby and even in certain
1597,which are the type 2 inflammatory expressed by the epithelial upon injury to the epithelial barrier,il25 il33 and
1598,which both b and t cell but play a crucial role in type 2 to perpetuate type 2 inflammation when,ilc2s are a group of lymphoid
1599,what is the effect cell death and injury to the epithelial barrier due to infection,induce the expression of il25 il33 and with heighten expression in an inflamed airway
1600,what when the 3 are expressed,these 3 then work in concert to activate ilc2s to further secrete type 2 il4 il5 and il13 which further aggravate the type 2 inflammation in the airway causing acute exacerbation
1601,what in the case of,ilc2 activation which retain the capability of to ilc1 may also further augment the neutrophilic response and further aggravate the exacerbation
1602,what during viral infection of healthy,these are not to any great extent and do not activate an ilc2 response during viral infection in healthy despite a type 2 exacerbation in chronically inflamed these classical of viral induced acute are in figure 1
1603,what upon viral infection in the airway,antiviral state will be to clear the pathogen from the airway immune response and injury from the infected epithelium normally would induce a rapid type 1 immunity that viral clearance
1604,what is the effect of the inflammation of the airway,however in the inflamed airway the and instead augmented the inflammation present in the chronically inflamed airway strengthening the neutrophilic infiltration in airway and eosinophilic infiltration in the asthmatic airway the effect is also further by the participation of th1 and ilc1 in the airway and th2 and ilc2 in the asthmatic airway
1605,what the severity of in the airway,the synergistic effect of viral infection with other
1606,why do not need to directly infect the lower airway to cause an acute exacerbation,he nasal epithelium remains the primary site of most
1607,what is by the fact that not all viral of the airway lead to acute,a more complex interplay between the virus and upper airway epithelium which synergize with the local airway environment in line with the united airway hypothesis

1612,who or reduced ability of viral clearance,with chronic airway inflammatory
1613,what does their impairment from,a type 2skewed inflammatory response which the airway of important type 1 responsive cd8 that are responsible for the complete clearance of
1614,where is this especially evident,in weak type 1 such as and
1615,what are other effects,there are also evidence of reduced type i and production due to type 2skewed inflammation which to imperfect clearance of the virus resulting in persistence of viral or the live virus in the airway epithelium
1616,what is the effect of viral in the airway,antiviral such as type i and resulting in prolong airway inflammation
1617,what do these do,enhance granulocyte infiltration thus the exacerbation such persistent inflammation may also be found within such as and whose generally persist longer further to chronic activation of inflammation when they infect the airway
1618,what is also linked with the chronic inflammation that the,human papilloma virus a virus highly associated with head and neck and respiratory papillomatosis
1619,what should be in the future,the role of infection in causing chronic inflammation in the airway and their association to of chronic airway inflammatory which is scarcely
1620,what further can viral persistence lead to,viral persistence which lead to continuous expression of antiviral may also lead to the development of steroid resistance which is seen with and infection
1621,what effect the use of to suppress inflammation can have,may also cause the virus to linger longer in the airway due to the lack of antiviral clearance
1622,what should be further focus of research,the concomitant development of steroid resistance together with recurring or prolong viral infection
1623,which may not cause inflammation due to strong induction of antiviral clearance,that induce strong type 1 inflammation and cell death such as and certain
1624,what do these cause,massive damage and cell death to the epithelial barrier so much so that of the epithelium may be completely absent post infection such as and cxcl10 which recruit immune to induce are strongly induced from infected epithelium
1625,what do the such as rip3 do,further the cell in infected epithelium the massive cell death induced may result in worsening of the acute exacerbation due to the release of their cellular content into the airway further an inflammatory response in the airway
1626,what may the destruction of the epithelial barrier cause,further contact with other and in the airway which may then prolong or in new
1627,what may the epithelial destruction cause,may also promote further epithelial during its regeneration as viral infection the expression of such as and growth that cause massive destruction of the epithelium such as usually result in severe acute with nonclassical of chronic airway inflammatory
1628,what is that with chronic airway inflammatory disease,receive their annual influenza vaccination as the best to prevent severe induced exacerbation
1629,what is another mechanism that viral use to drive acute,the induction of vasodilation or tight junction opening which may increase the rate of infiltration
1630,what does infection of respiratory cause,disruption of tight with the resulting rate of viral infiltration this also the of coming into contact with airway immune
1631,what is an example of this,infection was found to induce m which tight junction opening similarly and usually cause tight junction opening which may also increase the infiltration rate of and thus worsening of the classical of chronic airway inflammatory

1744,what was the economic impact in the us from the 2009 pandemic,at $ 30 $ 100 billion
1745,how is 2019ncov,2019ncov was through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia
1746,what are ways in which 2019ncov is,we found the presence of 2019ncov in anal and blood as well and more anal swab than oral swab in a later stage of infection suggesting shedding and thereby through oral – fecal route
1747,is oral swab for 2019ncov infection sufficient,the current strategy for the detection of viral in oral used for 2019ncov diagnosis is not perfect the virus may be present in anal or blood of when oral detection negative
1748,is oral swab for 2019ncov infection sufficient,infected with 2019ncov may harbour the virus in the intestine at the early or late stage of disease it is also worth to note none of the with viremia blood had positive these would likely be considered as 2019ncov negative through routine surveillance and thus pose a threat to other people
1749,what other should be considered for 2019ncov epidemiology,serology should be considered for 2019ncov epidemiology
1750,what should be done before a 2019ncov infected patient is,we cannot discharge a patient purely based on oral negative who may still shed the virus by route above all we strongly suggest viral and serological test to confirm an infection considering the unreliable from oral detection

1769,what were the surveillance,to describe the key epidemiological and clinical of covid19 in inform country preparedness and improve further case detection and management
1770,what is the adopted who case definition,a confirmed case was a person with laboratory confirmation of sarscov2 infection irrespective of clinical and whereas a probable case was a suspect case for whom testing for sarscov2 was inconclusive or positive a assay
1771,when was the first death in,15
1772,what is the incubation period,up to 14 days [
1773,what were the of infection,35 of whom 14 were infected in china the 21 were infected in
1774,what were linked to these,14 were linked to a cluster in and seven to a cluster in
1775,how many were,all but two were
1776,why were they,it is likely that most were to isolate the person rather than because of severe disease
1777,what was time from onset to,ranged between 0 and 10 days with a mean of 37 days
1778,what was the duration of,the mean number of days to was 25 days for from china but 46 days for those infected in
1779,why was this,this was mostly a result of in the index of the two in and in the german cluster for example the first three locally were in a mean of 57 days whereas the following six took only a mean of 2 days to be
1780,how many at this point,31
1781,how many were asymptomatic,two
1782,what were the asymptomatic tested as,as part of screening following repatriation and during contact tracing respectively

1793,how were the confirmed,according to specific at least two separate gene as a screening test and gene or nucleoprotein gene for confirmation
1794,what were the specimen for 21,15 had positive nasopharyngeal nine had positive throat three had positive sputum two had a positive nasal swab one case had a positive nasopharyngeal aspirate and one a positive aspirate
1795,as of 5 march 2020 what are the in the who region,there are 4250 113 among 38
1796,what were the two for transmission,sporadic among from china and who acquired infection due to subsequent local transmission in
1797,what does the analysis show on the difference between locally acquired,that the time from symptom onset to isolation was about 3 days longer for locally acquired than for
1798,what is for locally acquired,significant for contact tracing and quarantine and should be prepared to allocate considerable public health during the containment phase should local emerge in their population in addition prompt of information on and through international notification such as the international health mechanism and the early warning and response system is essential to contain international spread of infection
1799,what was common to all,had a history of travel to china
1800,what testing and detection are,testing of suspected based on geographical risk of importation needs to be with additional to ensure early detection of local circulation of covid19 through testing of severe acute respiratory in irrespectively of travel history as in the who case definition on 27 2020

1853,what serious question was raised,as to whether or not our seasonal or pandemic flu might have another reservoir host
1854,what is a recent discovery,bat is to harbor many more than we ever thought as a reservoir host or even a susceptible host
1855,which bat virus have been found to be linked with,potential human hku1 4 5 and 9 recent infection is another example for severe disease by pathogenic shi and by have discovered many unknown animal from bat especially some important and also been in bat with potential severe in the family have been linked with severe fatal human even in the with the of bats in the city
1856,what assay an important role,reverse transcription chain reaction
1857,what was the death toll in the 19181919 influenza epidemic,50 million
1858,how many people were infected during the 1918 influenza epidemic,an one third of the world ’ s population or z500 million were infected and had clinical ly apparent
1859,what was the case fatality rate in the 1918 influenza epidemic,case fatality were 25 % to 01 % in other
1860,what was the death toll in the 19181919 influenza epidemic,total were at z50 million and were as high as 100 mil lion
1861,are the modern day influenza related to the 1918 influenza virus,all a since that time and indeed almost all of a except ing human from avian such as h5n1 and h7n7 have been by of the 1918 virus “ ” h1n1 and h2n2 and h3n2
1862,why is the influenza virus the mother of the modern influenza,the latter are composed of key from the 1918 virus by — avian that code for novel surface * armed institute of pathology and of health making the 1918 virus indeed the “ mother ” of all
1863,when was it determined that the 1918 pandemic was by the h1n1 influenza virus,that question did not begin to be resolved until the 1930s when closely related now known to be h1n1 were isolated from and shortly thereafter from soon linked both of these to the 1918 pandemic
1864,did the influenza or swine flu or the h1n1 virus disappear in for some time,of the 1918 virus still in they probably also continuously in undergoing gradual antigenic drift and causing annual until the 1950s with the appearance of a new h2n2 pandemic strain in 1957 the direct h1n1 viral 0f the 1918 pandemic strain from human circulation entirely although the related lineage in
1865,when did the swine flu virus reappear in,but in 1977 human h1n1 suddenly “ ” from a laboratory freezer they continue to circulate endemically and epidemically
1866,what descendant of the swine flu virus were in 2006,2 major descendant of the 1918 h1n1 virus as well as 2 additional persist naturally a human h1n1 line age a porcine enzootic h1n1 lineage classic swine and the human h3n2 virus lineage which like the human h1n1 virus led to a porcine h3n2 lineage
1867,are the modern descendant influenza as dangerous as the 1918 parent swine flu h1n1 virus,none of these viral however the pathogenicity of the 1918 parent virus
1868,how dangerous are the modern h1n1 and the h3n2 to the 1918 h1n1,the human h1n1 and h3n2 lin have both been associated with substantially lower and death than the virus of 1918 in fact cur rent h1n1 death are even lower than those for h3n2 lineage
1869,are the descendant h1n1 of the 1918 h1n1 swine flu virus still prevalent,h1n1 from the 1918 strain as well as h3n2 have now been for 29 and show little evidence of imminent extinction
1870,is the origin and epidemiology of the 1918 swine flu known,ongoing to map virulence are yielding interesting the 1918 sequence data however leave unanswered about the gin of the virus and about the epidemiology of the pandemic
1871,what is the geographical origin of the h1n1 swine flu,historical and data are to identify the geographic origin of the virus and recent phylogenetic analysis of the 1918 viral genome does not place the virus in any geographic context
1872,is the geographical origin of the 1918 h1n1 swine flu known,confounding assignment of a geographic point of origin the 1918 pandemic spread more or less simultaneously in 3 distinct during an z12month period in 191871919 in and north the wave was best in the united in march 1918
1873,what is an unique feature of the 1918 swine flu,the simultaneous infection of and
1874,what season or time of the year do the new of influenza emerge,historical since the 16th century suggest that new may appear at any time of year not necessarily in the familiar annual winter of
1875,once when do the influenza like occur in subsequent,by the selection of population these pandemic begin to drift genetically and eventually settle into a pattern of annual epidemic recur by the virus
1876,when did the first wave of the h1n1 swine flu occur,a or spring wave in march 1918 and spread unevenly through the united and possibly over the next 6
1877,what was the death rate in the first wave of the 1918 swine flu pandemic,illness were high but death in most were not appreciably above normal
1878,when were the second and the third wave of the 19181919 swine flu pandemic,a sec or fall wave spread globally from to 1918 and was highly fatal in many a third wave in early 1919
1879,what was the primary difference between the first wave and the 2nd and 3rd wave of the 19181919 swine flu pandemic,the much higher of complicated severe and fatal in the last 2
1880,why the human influenza do not disappear after herd immunity is,the occurrence and to some extent the severity of recur rent annual are driven by viral antigenic drift with an antigenic variant virus to become nant
1881,what are the that promote the spread of influenza virus,lower environ mental and human nasal bene to thermolabile such as optimal humidity indoors and imperfect due to closed and suboptimal
1882,do seasonal and humidity explain the appearance of the three of the 1918 swine flu,such cannot explain the 3 pandemic of 19181919 which in the summer — fall and winter of the northern hemisphere respectively the 2 at a time of year normally unfavorable to virus spread the second wave simultaneous in the northern and southern from to
1883,which virus from the 1918 swine flu pandemic have been,pandemic virus we have yet are from
1884,are in the first and third of the 1918 swine flu pandemic same or derived from the virus from the second wave of the swine flu,nothing can yet be said about whether the wave or for that matter the third wave circulation of the same virus or of it
1885,was the 1918 swine flu virus novel to are was it derived from older,viral sequence data now suggest that the entire 1918 virus was novel to in or shortly before 1918 and that it thus was not a virus produced from old that acquired 1 or more new
1886,do avian flu change over long,virus gene from a number collected circa 1918 show little difference from avian isolated today that avian likely undergo little antigenic change in their natural even over long
1887,what is the typical age profile of mortality in influenza,the curve of by age at death for at least 150 been mortality in the very young and the very old with a comparatively low frequency of at all in between
1888,what was the age profile of mortality in the 1918 swine flu,death in the 1918 pandemic a distinct pattern that not been before or since a “ w — shaped ” curve similar to the familiar curve but with the addition of a third distinct peak of in young z20410 of age
1889,which age group was most susceptible to die during the 1918 swine flu pandemic,65 of age in 1918 had a high incidence
1890,what was the death rate among during the 1918 swine flu pandemic,those 5 to 14 of age for a disproportionate number of but had a much lower death rate from and pneumonia than other age
1891,what theory partial explanation for the profile of the death rate in the 1918 swine flu pandemic,the 1918 virus had an intrinsically high virulence only in those who had been born before 1889 because of exposure to a virus capable of providing partial against the 1918 virus strain only in old enough to have been infected during that prior era
1892,is there a difference in the pathologic feature and course of disease between modern influenza and the 1918 swine flu pandemic,the 1918 pandemic was different in degree but not in kind from previous and subsequent despite the nary number of global most in 1918 were mild and essentially indistinguishable from today
1893,could the 1918 swine flu virus been by modern day or,the 1918 and 1918like would be as sensitive as other typical virus to the food and drug and
1894,why was there such a high death rate in the 19118 swine flu pandemic,clinically and pathologically these high death appear to be the result of several a higher proportion of severe and complicated of the respiratory tract rather than involvement of organ outside the normal range of the virus also the were concentrated in an unusually young age group
1895,is the molecular basis of human adaptation of a virus understood,while data bearing on virus human cell adaptation receptor binding are beginning to be understood at the molecular level the basis for viral adaptation to human spread the chief prerequisite for pandemic is unknown for any virus

1979,what can undermine,poor governance public distrust and political violence
1980,who are to be particularly susceptible,affected by humanitarian crises
1981,why may be particularly susceptible,due to displacement crowded housing malnutrition inadequate water sanitation and hygiene and stigmatization
