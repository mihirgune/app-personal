0,a friend of my child's father is sending him inappropriate content,it sounds like you are wanting to protect your child from degrading images and that is one of the important parts of the job of a parent although it is challenging to supply an answer without knowing the full situation it might be helpful to have a more broad discussion about what you both think about the influences and images that your child is exposed to and what you think your role is in protecting your child this situation is one about beliefs and values and could well be an example you can use for exploring your parenting roles in protecting your child
1,about a year ago i found out my husband had cheated on me,first of all my heart goes out to you infidelity is an extremely challenging obstacle to overcome there are some things that you should consider first of all did he seem truly remorseful if you felt in his heart that he was truly sorry for what he had done it will give you a piece of mind that it was a  mistake secondly was he forthcoming with this information how about with answering your questions after the truth was uncovered if you found that he was still lying or not forthcoming the sting is even more painful he should be able to answer any question you have honestly and without hesitationthirdly has he shown a positive difference after this experience at this time he should still be proving his faithfulness to the marriage you and the childrenkeep in mind that experiencing infidelity is a form of grief it is not a quick process that can easily be overcome what you are experiencing is 100% normal my best suggestion would be to see a marriage therapist find out what drove your husband to cheat in the first place and decide if this aspect in his life has been resolved i know its important for you to keep your family together but children can sense anger and frustration this is not a healthy environment either if you decide that you can no longer remain in the relationship a therapist will also be able to help you cope with the separation along with addressing your childrengs needsplease know that you are not alone and that unfortunately many relationships have endured this very thing it may also be helpful to reach out to people who have experienced similar obstacles the web is a great resource to find groups whether online or in person to use as a support or sounding boardbest of luck to you and your family
2,all i can do is cry and hate myself,crying due to a dissolution of a marriage is normal  hating yourself may be a sign of extreme sadness feelings of loss and uncertaintydo you know why you hate yourself discovering your reason is the first step in knowing the obstacles and then the additional steps possible to move from hate to selflovedivorce signals a loss of familiar life structure and daily routines   as with any meaningful loss crying is part of mourning what is soon to be goneif you have confidence in your attorney's handling of the legal areas related to the divorce and the impossible you reference is on facing and coming to terms with statements and behaviors from your wife that you never noticed before then your best choice is to find a therapist whom you feel at ease in talking with to sort through the emotional upheaval within yourself and your everyday life and worlddivorce is a wonderful time for learning about ones own emotional needs and expectations in relationships since these are the areas currently coming apartthe good news behind losing something that seems valuable is that new space becomes open to attract what is more suitable for who you are
3,am i a lesbian because i love a girl,it all depends how old you are and what a particular situation is  you may be feeling very close to this friend and mistake that feeling for sexual feeling or the feelings may be real this is something you will find out for yourself however it definitely does not mean that you are a lesbian just because you have those feelings for this particular person time will tell but if you need to discuss this you could see your school councelor or find a lgbt group with meetings and discuss this with them i hope this is helpful
4,am i being picky when it comes to my boyfriend,well then your decision is whether you want to stay in this type of relationship or notone point to keep in mind is thisjust because he is not telling you his opinions does not mean he does not have any opinionsin the long run t is always easier to talk with someone about their differences from our point of view than to be someone who does not tell you what is in their mindshort term it seems easy to have someone agreeablelong term someone who does not tell you their thoughts and who disagrees with you may potentially go about their true wishes in hidden ways
5,am i gay if i like neither girls nor guys,it does not sound like you are finding yourself attracted to anyone  it could mean that you just have not connected with anyone you find attractive or that you are asexual  essentially not oriented toward anyone  i would suggest doing some reading on asexuality and see if it connects to how you feel
6,am i going to be alone forever,"i can relate when things are going badly i feel like my life has
always been and will always be that way but i also do this when things are
going well that is i forget how good things can turn bad personally to
avoid this emotional rollercoaster i try and heed the famous advice by author
and feminist rita mae brown one of the keys to happiness is a bad
memoryso maybe this weakness of your for forgetting is really a
strength it sounds a lot like living in the moment to me and while it’s hard
to manage my past and my future the moment seems like a small enough piece of
temporal real estate to sort out so that’s the “what” of my answer the “how”
goes like this choose one from column a two from column b and three from
column c in the following chart then try doing them for as long as you can
then see what happensa                                            b                                                  cgratitude                                forgiveness                                 appreciationexpectations                           meditation                                    exercisebitterness                               distraction                                    volunteering

think and believe are out of your control or that your values were imposed on
you or that nothing good will ever happen again then we will have to
respectfully disagree you’ve ask a very deep and insightful question proving
that your hope has gotten you this far hang onto that hope because i’m an
example of things working out despite my previous way of looking at my lifeinstead of “convincing”
yourself that you’re okay when you’re not how about calling it “accepting
yourself as okay just the way you are without judging your okayness” you
probably have high standards and that’s a thing to talk with a
counselor about the opposite of perfect is not horrible it’s called “good
enough”blocking out the bad things and
forgetting is as natural as eating and sleeping all the other mammals do it
 so why shouldn’t we this
might be called optimism
feeling alone and uncared for
is a worse feeling than being despised this is good this means 
that you don’t despise yourself as much as you just don’t care for you because
we can often project our own selfbeliefs onto others this is an abstract
concept that will take some time to get used to but i have a suspicion that
with just a little more selfcare and a little more caring for others you
might be better off very soon"
7,am i overreacting by breaking up with my boyfriend because he called me a particular profanity,it sounds like you are reacting to an issue in communication patterns rather than a particular word  the ability to listen considerately to your partner and to have your partner listen to you is one of the keystones of a successful relationship  if your partner is not listening to acknowledging and remembering your wishes that is likely an indicator of some fissures in the foundation of the relationship
8,am i somehow stressing myself out,i think you have identified something important here it is not unusual to experience feelings that do not seem to match up with what your rational mind recognizes in this case it sounds like a part of you recognizes that the people around you do not find you annoying and bothersome despite knowing that people like you it seems that there's still a part of you that feels like you are a botherfinding a local counselor who can work with you to process those feelings might be just the help you need
9,am i unworthy of being in a meaningful relationship,the most crucial key to any relationship is that mutual feeling you hold between you both that you matter sounds like you are stuck in a cycle of hearing your ex say you do not matter that is why it did not work with him btw he was not reflecting to you that you mattered however it ended clearly though that is the sentiment that is lingering with you so here you are hanging around a new man why is telling you the same message move on you are not unworthy you just have not found a man who is worthy of you to be worthy of you he must see your worth often though before anyone else can see your worth you have to believe it
10,am i wrong because i don’t want to sit on the same couch my wife had sex with another man on while we were still married,houston it is normal for this kind of thing to be a trigger so i get why you do not want to sit on it but to keep refusing keeps the affair alive am i to assume that you cannot afford a new one ideally she buys you a new couch but it certainly would be a gesture of love for you to do it too and it will help you both move forward t will be interesting to see if there's anything else that keeps the problem alive after the couch is long gone
11,any suggestions for erection problems,when a doc blows you off it may be a signal that it is time to find a new one ed can often be caused by health issues if all physical possibilities are ruled out then it is time to look within and enlist the help of a sex therapist here's a good article for you to start with
12,are some clients more difficult than others,each counselor will have their own list of difficulties in doing therapy work with a client  even if clinically trained similarly since counselors are human then their response to your question will reflect their unique differences as humanson my list is when the emotional pain i feel for someone describing some type of injustice or unfair treatment by another feels very deepsometimes i feel like avoiding the pain i feel by asking questions which will steer the conversation away from the painful areas the client talks aboutwhat in fact is necessary to clear out their pain is to step further into so as to realize their emotional pain is not greater than who they are
13,can i change my feeling of being worthless to everyone,if everyone thinks you are worthless then maybe you need to find new people to hang out withseriously the social context in which a person lives is a big influence in selfesteemotherwise you can go round and round trying to understand why you are not worthless then go back to the same crowd and be knocked down againthere are many inspirational messages you can find in social media  maybe read some of the ones which state that no person is worthless and that everyone has a good purpose to their lifealso since our culture is so saturated with the belief that if someone does not feel good about themselves that this is somehow terriblebad feelings are part of living  they are the motivation to remove ourselves from situations and relationships which do us more harm than goodbad feelings do feel terrible   your feeling of worthlessness may be good in the sense of motivating you to find out that you are much better than your feelings today
14,can i control anxiety without medication,you did not say what or how many medications you have tried certain anxiety medications can make you feel nauseous but i have not heard of any that cause mouth blisters so there may be some other underlying medical issue there i would definitely talk to your primary care physician and whoever has prescribed the medication as well as a neurologist if you have suffered a severe head injury there are so many medications available for anxiety or insomnia or even depression that there may be others with lesser side effectsbut beyond that have you tried any other treatments such as deep breathing or meditation meditation can be very effective but it takes practice and you do not have to sit crosslegged for hours chanting ohm to meditate it is about focusing on your breath rather than all the thoughts that are racing through your head and when they do take your mind off your breath simply refocus  like i said it takes practice so do not give up you can find many sites offering different ways to meditate so look around and see what works best for you like medication you just have to find the one that works best and that might take some experimentationi hope this helps and best of luck to you
15,can i get over ptsd on my own,when it comes to trauma especially in the event that it has caused you to develop ptsd there can be a lot of difficulty in attempting to resolve these issues on your own simply because of how strong your urge to avoid it whenever thoughts of the traumatic experience come up ptsd is best treated with the help of a mental health professional and if using the cognitive processing approach can be treated in as few as 17 weeks as for your other concerns many of these can be treated independently if you have the motivation to manage your way through panic attacks and depression specifically often respond well to selfhelp treatment manuals the centre for clinical interventions is a great online resource for workbooks to help you learn to manage the depression and panic attacks whether you decide to work through these concerns on your own or in professional therapy just know that your panic attacks must be managed prior to addressing your trauma hope this is helpful and if you have any other questions do not hesitate to ask
16,can i sign my brother into a mental health facility,i am sorry to hear that your brother has been having such a rough time he is lucky to have you on his side as far as whether you can sign him in that depends on a lot of different thingsi would suggest that you google the state and county that you live in as well as some phrase similar to crisis hotline they can tell you how it works in that county my guess is that you could sign him in as long as he met the criteria for admission at that moment but i cannot  be entirely sure you could also ask the person on the phone about financial responsibility i have not heard of that being a problem but i guess it would depend on insuranceif you have trouble finding a local  hotline consider calling the national crisis number and ask them to help you find someone local
17,can a person be mean towards another person if that person was treated poorly before,hi morristownthere's a saying that goes hurt people hurt people it is possible that your aggression towards your friends is connected to your mother's behaviours when we are treated poorly especially as children it affects how we ourselves others and the world it is also powerful modelling of aggressive behaviour the good news is that you have this lovely awareness and i think a desire to learn about yourself and grow in your ability to be respectful to people you care about i recommend you consider sitting down with a therapist and exploring these ideas and moving forward on that path you seem to want to be on good luck
18,can anxiety make me think i heard something about me,it sounds like you are having difficulty knowing if people are saying things to you or if you only thought someone was talking to you and this is anxiety producing it is understandable that it could be confusing andor a bit scary to be unsure if people are speaking to you or not it is hard to say exactly what is going on from just this description but if you can work with a competent therapist you may be able to get more insight into what is happening get clarity about your social interactions and develop some ways to deal with the anxiety
19,can hypnosis allow me to recall trauma from 35 years ago,i am not sure that i have the answer to your question but i can tell you that it would be helpful to talk with a certified hypnotist there are a list of them here httpwwwnatboardcomindex_filespage548htm you also may want to talk to someone who specializes in emdr this stands for eye movement desensitization and reprocessing and it is a specific trauma treatment i am not trained in this particular method but my understanding is that it does not require a lot of knowledge of the origin of the trauma before being started
20,can i learn to be happy alone,is it possible that even though your illness is chronic that it goes through phases in which you are more comfortable and that it requires less focus from you than at other timesi think the idea of having a lifelong illness is frustrating and can be depressing to think about  thoughts are not necessarily the truth of what will actually happen thoughillness makes negative situations look worse so be sure you are concentrating on specific areas of your life and not just assuming they will work out badly because you are illone way to be happy alone is to love and appreciate nurture and be kind to yourselfthis frame of mind may generate new answers to find ways of being among other people too
21,can implanted thoughts be reversed at all,given your experience of being imposed upon against your will and all the personal and professional loss that has come since your fear of what will happen if you undergo treatment and trust a therapist is understandable there is no technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away or be reversed however there are things that you can do which may help you to change your relationship to the thoughts and to the distress that they cause i understand that working with a therapist sounds risky given your experiences and at the same time a good therapist may be a beneficial resource in helping you deal with the intrusive thoughts cope with and alleviate the stress that they create and perhaps even lead to the alleviation of the thoughts themselves a therapist may also be able to help you discover strategies to work towards any goals you have around reconnecting with your children and working again if therapy feels too unsafe at the moment i would recommend looking into workbooks on how to deal with intrusive thoughts and coping with stress some popular approaches that you may want to look into are mindfulness techniques acceptance and commitment therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy you may even be able to find some of these resources at a library if affordability is an obstacle
22,can my marriage be saved,while it would be impossible for me to say whether your marriage can be saved it sounds like you are both willing to give it a try and to get professional support with appropriate professional support for your relationship a lot is possible i am not familiar with the resources available in jackson but i am sure there are some good local couple therapists and there may be some agencies that specialize in couple counselling and family therapy so often the challenges that we have in relationships result from rather small habits in relating that lead to greater feelings of distress loneliness anger and resentment i commend your willingness to put effort into creating the strong loving relationship that you want for both of your sakes and of course for your children the following links provides more information regarding common behaviours that predict staying together or separating and also videos and other resources that can help you get started wishing you and your family all the best on your journey of healing and discovery
23,can our marriage still be saved,sorry to hear about the stress in your relationship  there is definite value in being clear as you are about your own emotional investment in your husband and that you expect sexual exclusivity from him as part of the foundation of your marriagealso positive is your awareness that only your husband is the one who must similarly decide his own standards of being sexually exclusive to you or notwhether your marriage can be saved depends on what each person is willing to accept about the other oneis sleeping with other women the only criterion of what will satisfy you about being together with your husbandlove and care are not enough to make a marriage work partners need to be able to compromise and cooperate with each other that you care for him definitely intensifies any emotion you feel toward your husband  it intensifies any frustration and sadness about the relationship toodecide how much emotional sadness and hurt you are willing to tolerate and the reason you are willing to do sofrom what you write you are being very generous of yourself and not being reciprocated for thisif your husband does not start taking steps toward satisfying your wishes this may be your time to question your own generosity in waiting for him to do so
24,can someone love you and say hurtful things,pleasing someone certainly does feel satisfying  if the other person does not appreciate your effort and good will then this feels dissatisfyingoffering happiness to someone does not include tolerating mean comments such as the ones you describe heretell the person that you are trying to please them and also tell the person that their comments are hurtfulif the person said their words with no bad intentions then next time they comment its reasonable to expect these comments to not hurt your feelingskeep in mind that your good intentions may not be received in the way you intend them  some people sometimes are insensitive or just plain not interested in being pleased by another person
25,could a car accident add more problems to my posttraumatic stress disorder,you are right on to recognize that the effects of trauma can be cumulative  it is very possible that a car accident could lead to an increase in ptsd symptoms that were related to other traumatic experiencesif you have been deployed to a combat area you are most likely eligible for free counseling services through the va vet centers  the vet center clinicians typically have a lot of experience working with military trauma here's a link to a directory of vet centershttpwwwvagovdirectoryguidevetcenteraspyour service and sacrifice is greatly appreciated
26,could a rape that happened years ago be the cause of my anxiety,while anxiety can come about for many reasons trauma is definitely one of the factors that makes anxiety a possibility both immediately following a traumatic event and later in life when we have experienced such scary violations of our bodies  we may experience residual effects of fear for many years to come this is normal natural and in many ways helpful  at least initially this fear is in some way a sign that your bodymind is taking good care of you  trying to keep you on your toes in order to protect you from anything terrible happening to you again however as it sounds like you know anxiety feels awful and there are certainly ways of learning to reduce anxiety in order to get the tools you need to manage anxiety and also understand where it comes from and how it works in your life i would encourage you to seek professional help and check out anxiety resources online
27,dealing with an unfaithful and judgmental significant other,i do not think you’ve lost something i think you’ve found something  your breaking point and it is about time your boyfriend seems to be a very selfish and immature man who reconnects with you when it is convenient for him obviously he has his own issues but i want to address yours i agree you need to talk to someone the fact that you’ve put up with his repeated cheating and then letting him blame you for it  tells me you probably have low selfesteem and have likely told yourself over the years that you do not deserve any better you do you may truly love this guy but based on his behaviors he does not love you not in the way you deserve  and although you may want to believe he can change he has proved over and over again that he is not willing to so you need to do what is best for you and your children what would you tell your daughters if someone was treating them this way would you want your sons to treat women this way that is what you are teaching your children when they see thislike i said i agree that you should talk to someone you can ask your boyfriend to go too but my guess is he will not even if he does you should still see someone individually to work on you i understand it is not easy to just kick him out especially since you have children together but a counselor can help you talk through all the details while helping you raise your selfesteem and selfworth
28,did i make a mistake breaking up with a guy who said his exgirlfriend will always be on his mind,it sounds like you were in a tough spot herei am not able to tell you whether or not you made a mistake because the decision is yours i am wondering what led you to ask whether you made a mistake and whether you wish you were still in the relationship with this guy if so is it an option to talk about this with himif you decide to get back together consider having some conversations about what your concerns are and taking about five minutes or so to listen to this guy's thoughts feelings etc then see if you can repeat the essence of what he said to make sure you have it right then maybe you can ask some questions that you have and see if he is willing to listen when each of you is in the role of asking questions try to ask them as if you are an investigative reporter trying to learn more about each other's experienceif you are looking for information on coping with breaking up and you do not want to get back together or that is not an option consider looking at how you define yourself and what is most important to you at this moment i hear you saying you have done a lot of things to make him happy i am wondering what is making you happy hopefully you have friends or family that you can trust and talk to even if you do not talk about your relationship with all of them i hope you have some people around whom you can be emotionally safe and comfortable
29,do i have anxiety,everyone has some level of anxiety  it is what helps us respond to stressors in our lives and clues us into the fact that we need to respond to something going on however if you are feeling overwhelmed by racing thoughts feeling like you spend a lot of energy worrying about something specific or even pretty much anything at all and you are starting to find that it is getting in your way when it comes to living your life the way you want then i would suggest seeing a counselor or therapist for an assessment for anxiety your other concerns though seem pretty normal for someone who is in a relationship with a partner who has children as a married stepmother i have been there and as a therapist i can tell you that the boundaries and communication skills you have in your relationships need to be healthy for you to feel healthy finding some support from a group of others whose partners have children might be really helpful  being able to hear from others that you are not alone in feeling like this can really lighten the load and they might have some good ideas for handling certain situations another option is to find a counselor or therapist who has experience working with stepblended family dynamics  because even if you are not officially married those dynamics come into play whenever there are kids from another relationship involved you may even consider couples counseling so that both of you can learn to talk about your relationship needs and concerns in a way that will encourage connection and strengthen your sense of partnership
30,do i have bipolar disorder,hello and thank you for your question bipolar disorder is generally characterized by extreme changes in mood ranging from mania to depression  there are different types however so here is a website that gives you a list of symptoms for mania and depression in bipolar disorder httpwwwwebmdcomdepressionguidebipolardisordermanicdepressionpage2after reviewing these symptoms if you believe you may have bipolar disorder then you may want to see your primary care provider or a counselor bipolar disorder is treatable but for many people it requires the right medication and sometimes counseling to help people make behavior changes that are important for bipolar management for example some people may not get regular sleep but proper rest is important for bipolar management a counselor may talk to you about this and other lifestyle changes that you may need to make the good news is that many people live happy healthy and productive lives with bipolar disorder so if it turns out that you do have bipolar disorder it does not mean that things cannot get better there is currently no cure for bipolar disorder but with proper medication and lifestyle management people can do quite wellhope this was helpful be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
31,do i have social anxiety,it sounds like a couple of things are going on here you are noticing yourself feeling judged by the people around you and that you are avoiding social activities and in addition to this you have intrusive thoughts that you are being judged even when alone it sounds like these thoughts are pretty distressing and you are wondering what is happening to you many people who come to therapy experience intrusive and distressing thoughts of various kinds which often influence their behavior in ways that they may not like such as leading them to isolate in therapy you may be able to gain insight into the nature of your distress as well as learn ways to cope and eventually alleviate this distress so that you can have satisfaction and security in your life and relationships
32,do i have some type of anxiety,it is possible that you could have or be developing an anxiety disorder there is not really enough information provided here to suggest a particular disorder but it might be worth meeting with a counselor or therapist to do a formal assessment some of the questions they might ask could be what other kinds of physical symptoms you experience how frequently these physical symptoms happen what's going on for you when they tend to happen and how frequentlyintensely you find yourself worrying in general anxiety itself is a really natural thing  it is just when it starts interfering with your ability to do life the way you want that we start to consider potential disorders it might be that for the most part the anxiety you feel is normal and you simply have some triggers that intensify it more than usual working on your own or with the support of a counselortherapist to both address those triggers at the root and also to develop ways of managing the actual anxiety symptoms this twofold approach can be really helpful for not letting anxiety keep you from engaging in life the way you would like
33,do i have too many issues for counseling,let me start by saying there are never too many concerns that you can bring into counselling in fact most people who come to see me for counselling have more than one issue they would like to work on in psychotherapy and most times these are all interconnected in counselling we work together collaboratively to figure out which issues you would like to address first and then together we develop an individualized plan of care basically it’s like a road map of where you want to go how are you going to get there looking at stopovers some scenic routes others possibly not so scenic however necessary of course these plans can also change due to internal or external reasons  i would encourage you to take the next step and reach out to a professional you can trust and build rapport with by cojourneying through whatever concerns you have by examining what has been working so far as you have learned to cope with some of your issues like insomnia depression and anxiety as well as being a breast cancer survivor then to help you by developing new coping strategies psychotherapy can be such a powerful tool to help you get to where it is you want to be i know you can do it and you will see firsthand how psychotherapy will help you to move past these points in your life where you are feeling stuck i like to quote nike where their motto is “just do it” you can do it
34,do i leave my cheating husband or share him with someone,hi jayuya i am struggling in this moment with my own biases i have biases that are about respect and every individual's need for and right to respect your husband lies cheats and physically hurts you he makes excuses and blames you for these behaviours and trains you to do the same he demonstrates many controlling and abusive behaviours and now in an attempt to manipulate and silence you he wants to have his cake and eat it too and suggests you should share him there are not many crumbs of this cake left for you are thereso my biases about respect do not make me want to rescue you or tell you what to do i cannot do that and i do not think either of those things will help you i would like to ask you some questions thoughare you happy do you know what happy is do you know what respect is are your children safe are your children witnessing violence  do you have supports do your family and friends know what's happening in your life have you ever been to a womengs shelter are you willing to sit down in an office with a professional who can help you think clearly that is what i suggest these are big decisions you deserve some support i wish you the best
35,do i text call or make contact first the same day of the morning i left his house,it is possible your question reflects some insecurity about whether or not either or you would like this relationship to continueotherwise the answer to your question would appear naturally  if you genuinely feel close enough to this person to sleep with him then who texts whom first would not really matter too muchtry to understand within yourself whether you feel truly interested in this person as much as you would like to feel toward someone
36,do feelings of depersonalization go away,best answer that i can give to you is that some level of depersonalization is quite normal for everyone it will come and go throughout life kind of like being on a rollercoaster here it is then it is gone not to return for quite some time like many things the more that you fixate on it the more stress it will cause you consider it part of life accept it and move on now if your having many many many of these episodes or have some auditory or visual hallucination or disturbances or emotional unbalancing that accompany it than that is definitely something to look at but for the most part nothing to worry about hope this helpsc
37,do narcissists get healed by rationalizing,it is not correct because someone who is narcissistic believes they are always rightif you ignore the person then their thinking is that there is something wrong with youignoring the person to the degree this is possible in the situation or relationship will spare you to be misunderstood further

39,does my daughter have a mental disability,depending on your daughter’s age this could be a learning disability  i suggest contacting the school counselor and asking for an evaluation once she is evaluated and depending on the diagnosis she could be provided with treatment recommendations like occupational therapy reading glasses or assistance in class these and more accommodations are enforced under the 504 act consider if the observations that you have done are affecting her performance in school only or also in other settings  observe her behavior and or her emotions and see if they change as well  discuss these with your daughter’s counselor as well¿tiene mi hija un desorden mentalmi hija está en la escuela elemental  ella no puede colorear dentro de la línea  mezcla las palabras cuando escribe a menos que tenga grandes espacios o brinca las líneasdependiendo de la edad de tu hija esto puede ser un problema de aprendizaje  te sugiero que contactes al consejero escolar y solicites una evaluación dependiendo de la diagnosis ellos pueden recomendar tratamientos como terapia ocupacional lentes para leer o asistencia en clase   estos acomodos son provistos bajo la acta 504  considera si las observaciones que has hecho afectan el desempeño de tu hija en la escuela o en otras áreas también observa su conducta y emociones y repórtaselo al consejero escolar
40,does my fiancée need a service dog,it sounds like you have been a positive support for your fiancee there is no doubt that this situation is a great challenge for the both of you while it may feel like you are responsible for her health and happiness it is important that you understand that you on your own will not be able to resolve her mental health issues based on what you have explained it sounds like she needs to get a medical andor psychiatric evaluation whether or not she decides to take medication is her decision but keeping an open mind about treatment options is important i suggest that she see a therapist on her own in order to better understand and cope with her anxiety and depression especially given her suicidal thoughts you would also likely benefit from therapy individual or couple's therapy in order to address how you are feeling and best learn how to support her and your relationship i wish the very best for both of you and hope that things will improve sooner than later
41,does my friend have depression,first of all i can tell that you really care about your friend and i think it is great that you are reaching out with your concern it is hard to determine whether your friend would meet the criteria for an official diagnosis of depression without working with him however whether he does or not therapy may be beneficial for him in working through these difficult feelings and relational challenges unfortunately you cannot make your friend get help he will ultimately need to make that decision for himself however you can talk to him about your concerns and your hopes that he will reach out for help
42,escalating disagreements between mother and wife,what you are describing is something psychologists have termed triangulation which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead you have been triangulated by your wife and motherthis is often seen in families it is seen everywhere how many times have you had a problem with someone but you did not go to them to tell them you went to someone else to complain it is usually difficult for a person to confront another especially in relationships where there is a power differential for example i bet it is easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complainti am not saying triangulation is always a bad thing sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree that is what therapists do every day sometimes just getting someone else's perspective can help you see the issue clearer however in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem you are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you loveif you want to put a stop to this triangulation you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up even if they really do not like each other and cannot get along your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior it is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other these are the two most important women in your life and they both know it your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife i heard one motherinlaw describe her songs wife as the gateway to her son the wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son the wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren if your wife does not like her motherinlaw she can severely hamper or damage her motherinlaw's relationship with you and any children you two may have from your wife's viewpoint this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to if you regularly praise your mom's cooking her housework gardening or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated this can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike i am not saying that this is the case with your family's situation these are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours regardless of what the cause is if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you do not agree with them they will get upset if you do not align yourself with them against the other they will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other one's side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should in worst cases if it continues to escalate you may even find yourself in the impossible position of having to choose between your wife and your mother which may mean cutting off contact with the other ending that relationship change the dynamics before it spirals even further
43,how am i supposed to feel when i forgive someone,how someone feels when they forgive another is at peace with themselves and their understanding of what went wrong who was responsible for what in the situation and clarity on their own motivation actions emotions including pain regret resentment sadnessthese steps ideally allow a new door to open in order to develop new paths in the existing relationship or accept that this will not be possible due to either persongs way of handling themselvesthe long answer would be that you are not yet through with this processi commend you on being truthful with yourself about yourselfyou are on the right track by expecting to feel resolved when you have reached resolution and not beforefinding patience with the unpredictable amount of time needed to thoroughly examine all the details of the incidents you mention sometimes is a frustration of its ownkeep up your good work of knowing your own lifeit is a worthwhile endeavor
44,how can i ask my boyfriend about who he is texting,i agree with sherry that in a close intimate relationship you are entitled to ask questions about his relationship with significant others these questions help couples to build connection and trust it is based on the idea that if you reach out to him for whatever reason  you can count on him and can expect him to be responsive how he responds to your question will give you an idea whether he helps you to feel more emotionally secure and builds trust or if you feel that you cannot be open with him if your partner responds in an open and understanding manner it usually indicates that he cares about your feelings and values your importance if he responds in a defensive manner it could mean that he does not like that you are questioning your trust in him or that he has something to hide either way you may wish to explain that building trust is something that is very important to you in a relationship and that talking to him openly helps to foster that if he continues to be defensive or evasive then there might be some bigger issues at stake and the two of you may benefit from couples counselling or having a discussion about the values that are important to you in the relationship and how the two of you will go about supporting those values with actionsdr virginia chowwwwpsychologyresourceca

46,how can i avoid becoming wrapped up in family issues and control my anxiety about them,based on the information provided this is an issue with boundaries   sounds like your uncle goes to your mom and possibly your mother takes the issues to you  i do not like to assume so i will direct you to information regarding families dealing with enmeshment and triangulation  enmeshment is the concept of diffused boundaries in families and other personal relationships  triangulation is two individuals relaying information to a third party what cannot be said directly to each other  from someone who has dealt with both these issues on a personal level being informed about family dynamics is beneficial and can help you develop healthy boundaries for yourself within your family structure  you may need assistance with developing healthy boundaries  although it is possible it is not easy to change the way you have been operating for any extended amount of time  hope this help
47,how can i avoid family members who stress me out,it is understandable that it is very hard for you to hear daily complaints from your mother regarding the caregiving of your niece you cannot change your mother's feelings and responsibilities which could create feelings of frustration and helplessness it must be equally hard for your mother to assume full responsibility for your niece at a time where your sister cannot take care of her this type of responsibility usually produces an enormous amount of stress and pressure because your mother and niece would both need to adapt to this new relationship living situation and the feeling of being abandoned not knowing the history of your relationship with your mother and how you respond to each other in times of need it may be difficult to fight the right recommendation on how to deal with this situation nonetheless it is not easy to have to face daily complaints and you may have to set a healthy balance between empathy and boundary setting with your mother and some personal boundaries for yourself it is likely that your mother's complaints may be her desperate cry for help because she does not know how to cope with stress or how to ask for the right kind of support in this case you could calmly and respectfully tell her the next time you hear her complain this must be very difficult for you because i hear the stress in your voice almost everyday it is very hard for me to hear you feeling so overwhelmed i feel helpless in this situation and would like to suggest that it might be helpful for you to seek some professional help and support to deal with such a big matter of importance when empathy and understanding is communicated recipients are usually more open because they hear and feel the caring behind it and are more likely to seek additional helpafter sharing this message of empathy and encouragement to seek help the next step is to protect yourself by explaining to your mother where your limits are so that she understands what she can expect from you this means that you can decide the kind of support or help you are willing to give your mother andor niece that is within your ability to provide without feeling overwhelmed this could involve inviting them to dinner occasionally taking them out to see a movie or inviting your niece over to give your mother respite you could then say to her if she complains again i cannot change the way you feel in this situation and i encourage you to seek professional advice about that but what i could do is wwwpsychologyresourceca
48,how can i avoid having past traumatic experiences affect my present and future,sorry that your growing up years in the family were so unsafe and painfuleveryone has family legacy patterns of behavior and ways of handling emotions handed down to them simply by livingall of what any child observes and how they are treated within their family context creates their foundational expectations of othersthe best way of releasing yourself form hurtful interaction patterns is by being aware of your own feelings and intuition within close relationshipsif you have a similar sense of hurt or that something is wrong yet in a familiar way then most likely you are in a relational pattern similar to the negative ones in your family of originthis realization moment is your chance to more deeply see your own original trauma and try different ways of responding to these similar key situationsthis type of work takes a lot of repeated effort because trauma is deep and childhood trauma is attached to loving ones parentsexpect slow progress and expect more than a few tearsif it feels overwhelming then a therapist for guidance and support would be very beneficial to the work you would be doing within yourselfsending lots of good luck
49,how can i be happier and healthier,i know some people do better when they do not have as much junk food in the house this is not as tempting then having said that maybe you can reward yourself with different things such as having dessert on certain days if you are concerned about mostly eating habits consider seeing a nutritionist they can help you find the balance between what it is that you really want and your goals i am not sure how this links to happiness for you but hopefully looking at your choices can lead you toward your goal of being healthier
50,how can i be happy again,as silly as it may sound making sure that we are getting the right amount of *restful* sleep is very important when we are feeling low  the reason for this is the lack of proper sleep significantly affects our ability to problem solve and critically evaluate our situation and can lead to a domino effect in our thinking  i know you feel that you may be losing your friendships but what are the facts that have led to this belief really ask yourself are they facts or are they your perspective on events  in regards to your coping behaviours at night it sounds very isolating and also very silenced  as opposed to the sad music why not try all music allowing yourself to experience the wide breadth of emotions that are circling within you  one of the other recommendations i would make would be to try and journal about some of those thoughts and fears in order to release them in a positively cathartic way some of the behaviours that you have mentioned are a bit more significant though and i would recommend speaking with someone directly in the near future
51,how can i be happy as a stayathome mom,there are an infinite number of possibilities here you included a lot of things that you do not have is there anyway that you can have some freedom for a few hours a week at least a lot of times stay at home moms have groups when they meet at different public places where their children can play together and they can talk together i do not know how old your child or children isare but perhaps going back to work is something that can happen in the futurei wonder if you may consider who you have in your life who can support you i do not know whether you have a spouse or parents or siblings who could help out with some different things i wonder if you could consider where you would like to go if you had two or three hours that you could do whatever you wanted if you can sort out some possible answers to that maybe you can work together with friends or family to make it happenalso again depending on the age of your children some parents can do things while the children are sleeping even if you are in the same room for example if your children are sleeping for about two hours maybe 30 minutes of that could be reserved for you and the rest could be for cleaning or other things you need to do
52,how can i be interested in the same sex after nearly 40 years of being straight,what most people do not know is that sexual preferences can be fluid meaning our sexual orientation is not as fixed as most people believe  women in particular tend to be more fluid in their desire to express and experience sex  it is not uncommon for heterosexual women in their midlife to explore new sexual appetites  that said men tend to be more rigid in their orientations particularly if they are hetero while gay men tend to be more fluid  so if your distress is over your new interests i would tell you you are not alone and not abnormal  since you have started exploring enjoy and consider seeing a therapist to help you navigate your feelings around this new sexual life warm wishes
53,how can i be less afraid of people,maybe the problem is learning to trust yourself to not be afraid other peoplereflect on what you believe would increase your trust of believing your own judgement on whom to trustif you have had any type of violation during your growing up years or witnessed someone in your family be violated emotionally physically or through some terrible accident or incident then you may hesitate to believe other people are safe and not to be fearedgive yourself plenty of time and reassurance that as long as you are making sincere effort to increase you comfort around other people eventually you will succeed
54,how can i be less afraid of rape,your fear is somewhat reasonable  no one wants to be raped and i imagine everyone is afraid of what being raped would feel likedo you mean that this fear is on your mind more often than you would likeif this is the case then try understanding the reason behind your fearis it because you personally know or know of someone who was raped  one general direction of what would help is to regain confidence in your decisions of keeping yourself safe  the more you trust yourself to avoid social situations with lots of drinking isolated physical surroundings and being in isolated locations with someone with whom you are not very familiar probably your fear will decreasethe other general direction to understand is if in your family history people have been violated severely either emotionally mentally or physicallyin families in which people have suffered severe violations of themselves often the emotional patterning of expecting to be hurt by others plants itself very deeply and transmits to the younger generationits possible then that you are suffering from fears established in other family members who have not yet been able to fully understand and accept their own sufferingthe good news is that individual therapy with a credentialed and licensed therapist is ideal for a safe place to open and clear this type of emotional burden
55,how can i be less angry,anger is not necessarily a bad thing if you are angry and you can talk about your feelings that would be very helpful anger usually comes along with something else like feeling sad worried overwhelmed confused and many others consider looking at what you notice in addition to anger and you may have a different starting point if you get along well with friends and do not get angry with them look at the differences do you feel criticized by your parents or family misunderstood there could be any number of thingsi wonder if you start getting angry very slowly and it builds or if it happens quickly try to keep an eye on the patterns and see if you can stop and look at what else is going on as you start to get angry anger is a real emotion in itself it almost always connects to something else as well

60,how can i be less stressed out,one way to understand panic attacks is as a sign of feeling insecure or lacking confidence in a certain area or characteristic of yourselfthe insecurity can sometimes feel overwhelming and this starts the sense of panic one way to build your sense of security within yourself is to have a simple life and a slow paced life   when there are many activities or involvements to pay attention then it is easy to not give full attention to all of them  this may trigger a sense of insecurity since in fact you may not have had sufficient time to study and know your own opinion about all of what your life is immersed ina simpler life of fewer activities allows more time to know and understand your own inner feelings and reactionsto know more about yourself may help build your confidence and security in your ability to know and live what goes on in your life

62,how can i be more confident around girls,i recommend that you focus on the negative thoughts or irrational beliefs that are going through your mind at the time in which you are trying to approach a girl when you are aware of the negative thoughts or irrational beliefs you can then work on changing them an easy way to recognize an irrational belief is a thought that contains the words must or never once you recognize the thought or belief i would like you to picture a big red stop sign this is called thought stopping this is a technique to use to stop unwanted or unhealthy thoughts then i would like you to think of a more positive thought to replace it with such as negative thought that girl will never go out with me stop positive thought i will not know if she will go out with me unless i ask what this does is increase your self confidence by replacing your negative thoughts with positive ones that will ultimately boost your self esteem
63,how can i be more open and honest with my dad,hi troy i totally get this it is a dilemma you want your dad to know how he is hurting you but you do not feel safe enough to say anything to him your reaction is understandable it is his responsibility as a parent to work harder than you to create that safe place for you to be open but that is not who your dad is your dad is your dad and waiting for him to change will not really help nothing you do can change your dad butthere are things you can do for yourself and your relationship with him while your response of avoiding him is understandable i wonder what effect it has on your dad it is possible that he is feeling frustrated rejected and punished by your withdrawal you may think he knows that you are feeling hurt but he probably does not so this is the squirrel chasing its tail your dad is rude so your habit is to be silent then he maybe feels abandoned and frustrated his frustration comes out as more rudeness which makes you want to withdraw more and the cycle starts all over again you cannot change his part of the cycle but you can change yoursare you willing to take a risk can you be honest about how you are feeling what's the worst thing that could happen if you said to your dad you know why i avoid you i stay silent because when i talk to you say rude things so if you want me to talk i need to know you can listen i imagine it would come out differently because you are a few generations younger than me but put that into your own wordsi do not know the level of your dad's 'rudeness' if he is abusive then a better plan is to see a therapist alone or talk to someone about this i do not want to put you at any risk but if you do not worry your dad will hurt you maybe give honesty a trymy point is that as rude as your dad may be checking out of a relationship by being silent is also rude it is powerfulyour silence your dad cannot read your mind and if you want things to be better you will need to get in that ring with himand if you are both open to it seeing a therapist together can be really helpful

72,how can i control my temper,anger is a normal emotion no different than joy elation or sadness it is not anger that gets us in trouble it is the overtness of the emotion or how we allow it to manifest that gets us in trouble being able to control your temper depends on several variables how you saw anger acted out as a child in terms of your primary caregivers and what you internalized as being normal in terms of managing conflict and your communication style regarding how you confront problematic situations there are some whose anger takes on a volcano effect whereby they do not readily address problematic situations but rather they continue to stuff their emotion until the right trigger causes them them to explode and then there are those who are very impulsive in terms of how they react to stressful situations they do not take time to think out situations or to make sense of them they just impulsively respond i would encourage you to seek anger management from a therapist who utilizes a cognitive behavioral approach in order that you may explore how your irrational thinking related to certain situations may be influencing your problematic behavior in addition i would encourage you to engage in activities that promote stress reduction if your blowups are indeed related to being overly stressed the first step is recognizing that you have a problem that you need help in understanding and addressing which you have now take the next step in finding a therapist in order that you may learn to control your temper and undo some faulty wiring that may be related to how you process emotion and communicate that you are angry remember anger is the overt expression of some other emotion hope this helps

77,how can i cope with depression,one thing that may help is to focus on small things that you do have control over if you can hold onto that sense of having control over what you wear or what you choose to eat or where you go during the day this may help you be able to look at what is currently most important for you and consider different choices for example you say you cannot get a job but i wonder if you could work with and local agencies to help you find a job like career link you say you have no friends currently are there any previous friends that you can get back in contact withyou mentioned that you have no friends is there anyone in your life that you can talk with even if it is not someone that you consider a closest friend
78,how can i cope with work related stress better,i think it is important to tease more of this situation out to figure out what is at the root of the stress it is emotionally dangerous to be at a job for a lengthy duration in which you feel overworked and underpaid you will not perform well as you mention and thus your selfesteem will continually take a hit without really any effort so i do not know that simply coping with your stress would be advisable as a first stepyou do not speak about a lot of what the office dynamics are like which can be a big indicator for me of what can be done to help you feel better i would encourage you to speak up about your contributions to your boss often overworked and underpaid also includes the my boss never notices me and that can demoralizing if we feel appreciated that can go a long way i have found that it is quite common for bosses to require some instruction for how to show each of their employees appreciation but sometimes appreciation is not going to do the trick either because that overworked and underpaid actually has led you to feel burnout you have zero interest in doing the job in the way it is designed so some real changes need to be implemented the bottom line try not to just suck it up and do all of the self care work on your own if your company is not helping you to take care of yourself then you also have to question if this is a company worth working for while i do not know exactly what you do it sounds like you have confidence in your contributions so take that confidence to a tech company that will support you 
79,how can i create a better relationship with my adoptive mother,going to see a experience counselor would be my advice  you will have a neutral person that can listen to both sides and help you all find a common ground of understanding  if she does not agree to counseling really the only person you can change is you  i would suggest that you approach her with love and let her know what you appreciate about her let her know the great things she have done that could not be replaced or forgotten however you want your relationship to get better than it has been lately  hopefully this will open the door of communication where you can explain your thoughts and feeling but in a loving way

81,how can i deal with a “crush” in a relationship,i can only imagine how hard that must have been to hear on one hand most of us would say we want our partners to always be honest with us but on the other disclosures like this can lead to feelings of worry and inadequacy if we are not careful so let me first of all say that it is very normal for human beings even very committed and happy partners to have moments where they notice an attraction for someone else quite honestly the brain cannot help it it sees something good looking and it pays attention and when we pay attention to something good our brains send out neurochemicals associated with that happy thoughtand we get a rush of what your girlfriend is labeling a crush the difficulty here is deciphering whether she was just attempting to honor her commitment to you by sharing this feeling or if she is continuing to feed those feelings i would encourage you to thank her for being honest if you have not already and ask her to further describe the nature of these feelings and what she would like to do from here as weird as it is to say at the end of the day what helps the most is typically reassuring yourself that you will be okay not matter what that it is worth it to invest in your relationship and give it your all and if someday god forbid this woman chooses to walk away then she is not the one will it hurt of course but is it the end hell no there are 75 billion people on the planet and i firmly believe statistically speaking alone there are at least several hundred thousand that could be amazing partners for you cheering you ontamara powell lmhcps you might enjoy this excellent book by esther perel for further inquiry into the fascinating world of love and mating behaviors mating in captivity”

90,how can i deal with the stress of my mother,this is a common issue you grow up gradually and parents often forget to shift their habitual responses according to your newfound level of maturity and growing need for freedom and independance i am all for helping you find new ways to cope and interact with your mom ultimately you only have control over yourself so that is the place to start you can remind yourself that mom's behaviours do not mean that she does not trust you or love you it is just that she has habitual ways of talking to you that seem stuck in the fourteen year old range if you can see her responses as habits rather than a reflection of how she feels about you then you can keep yourself calm the more calm you are the more she will buy into it when you invite her into a different sort of relationship take a look at the picture from her perspective she may feel overwhelmed with finances  and feel burdened by the mundane tasks in life that she does not know how to recruit help for i bet your mom spends a lot of time picking up after you cleaning cooking doing laundryall those thankless mom tasks take a look at how she talks to you is she nagging about chores can you see that underneath the nagging there's a pretty overwhelmed and powerless person who needs assistance  okay so my guess is that you both have a legitimate beef she wants help you want respect let's talk about how you get bothi propose that you sit down with mom and negotiate out a different sort of dynamic momi see us as stuck in how we interacted when i was fourteen can we do this differently in a way that we both get what we want sell it as winwin then you write down some things that end up forming a contract the first part is stuff that is your business and your business alone things you want your mom to respect like your room your school your job your personal relationships and hygiene mom's voice has no place in these arenas unless you are storing food in your room and it is a health hazard this is a mom says nothing about list the second part is about what mom needs from you what are her expectations about your role in the home as an adult does she want you to contribute to rent buy your own food do your own laundry what items can we put in your control that would take some burden off of mom how will these things be enforced what will happen if you do not follow through write it all down so it is really clear it has to all be mutually agreed uponthe third part of the conversation is about how she talks to you and how you talk to her you can let her know that you do not want to be told what to do or when to do it that does not work when you are 20 years old listen to what she wants too beyond the contract you have just written up anything else you want from each other is a request it is optional and whether and when you do it is at your discretion my guess is that if she spoke to you with more respect you would be more willing to help out and i think if you participated a bit more she would nag at you less go for the winwin i wish you well as you negotiate a new relationship with mom 
91,how can i deal with this anxiety that keeps me up all night,anxiety is usually a sign of a current problem to which familiar emotional patterns of feeling similarly upset attach themselvestry to understand more about who you are what you like feel uneasy about especially your deeper emotions of being emotionally harmed or injured by meaningful peopleanxiety is best addressed indirectly by understanding and kindly accepting previous hurt and fears from long agoonce you feel at ease with dynamics of past situations then the current anxiety will decrease  this is because you will have adjusted and found new ways of handling otherwise frightening and overwhelming interactions and involvements with others

95,how can i find myself again,if you are a peoplepleaser type or a natural caretaker you can slowly lose yourself over time if you are always tending to the needs of others and neglecting yourself  if this sounds like a familiar pattern for you this may have happened without you even realizing it if you were raised in a family where you had to pick up the slack alot  maybe your parents were addicts or they might have even just worked all the time and you learned to take care of everything because that is what you had to do to help the family run smoothly over time a person who grows up in this type of environment learns that you put the needs of others before your own  you might also be stuck in these types of patterns in intimate relationships as well if you completely give yourself over to your significant other and you do not create a life for yourself with your own interests and supportive friends you are at risk of losing what is unique and amazing about you  if you grew up in a family where you learned this role out of survival or because it was needed to take care of your family it is easy to recreate this in adult relationshipsin both scenarios if there is no awareness that this self sacrifice at the expense of others is going on your identity is shaped around being a caretakerenablerpeoplepleaser and down the road it can lead to depression low self esteem and a confused sense of self  basically you spend so much time helping other people that you do not make time for yourself or create a life of fulfillment  before you realize it you have been living a life for others instead of yourself and you have no idea who you are  supporting loved ones and friends is important and certainly admirable but if you are always that person that rescues those that rely on you begin to take advantage of you and they will suck you dry if you let them  in conclusion learning to set boundaries with those in your life that are too needy becomes a really important part of the process when you begin to recognize that you are unhappy and unfulfilled in life  it sounds like you may be at that crossroads right now  take one small step at at a time  identify the worst offenders in your life that suck time and energy and limit your contact andor set some strong boundaries with those people so you can refocus and do some soulsearching  meanwhile engage in pleasurable activities with people you enjoy being with get yourself outside in the fresh air get some good sleep and eat some nourishing food

97,how can i forgive myself,hi ohio i totally get how it can be more difficult to forgive ourselves than to forgive others my guess is that you tend to come down too hard on yourself a lot that is a huge barrier to happiness that you can work to reduce i will get you startedyou feel shame in a debilitating way that is probably way out of proportion to the incident is it triggering some old shame unfortunately a lot of adults use shame as a motivator for kids it does not work when was the first time you remember feeling a lot of shame as in i am bad or i am worthless is there a younger version of you who is still feeling shame over something that was not your fault sometimes shame shadows are connected to an absent or hurtful parent sexual abuse or some family loss or trauma if so picture yourself at that age can you tell your child self that whatever horrible thing happened to them is not their fault can you have compassion for that child who first felt shame or had shame heaped on them that is your first goalto go to the source of the shame and heal that child's wound with compassion what happens to children is never their fault once you take the layers of old i am bad shame off the load is lighter and you can use self talk to further reduce the shame here are some things you can say to yourselfevery dayi am human and that is okay i do not have to be perfecti can have compassion for my mistakesi can feel proud that i am facing my mistake and making things righti deserve forgiveness and compassion and i have that for other people toothere's no purpose to holding on to shamei can learn from my mistakes and move forwardeveryone makes mistakesother people do not want me to carry this shame aroundi do not need shame to remind me not to do it again i have figured that outshame tries to convince you that you need to carry it around in order to prevent further mistakes poppycock  you have learned your lesson now you can move forward to other mistakes sorrybut you are human and you will keeping making hopefully different glorious mistakes embrace the learning lean into the experiences of life it is all juicy stuff and you are in good company we are all in the same position of being mortal

99,how can i get out of my head and stop obsessive thoughts,scary thoughts can feel overwhelming at times as well as feeling quite real i want to acknowledge how scary they can feel but there is hope and new skills you can learn to work with these types of thoughts the first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them i also realize that might seem really hard to do but here's a good way to think about the brain and how thought patterns work thoughts arise in the mind all the time our brain is a thought machine many thoughts drift by like clouds and we do not pay any attention while other thoughts arise and they trigger us in a particulate way ie scary angry happy sad and when those thoughts arise we can chose to pay more attention to the thought which can lead us down that particulate thought stream that will lead to fear and anxiety so how do we work or stop those scary thought streams one new skill to implement comes from the work of rick hansen he wrote the book buddha's brain he teaches that we need to give more energy and attention to the positive thoughts or positive memories we hold in our mind and pay less attention to the negative thoughts hansen asks us to imagine the brain this way the brain is like velcro with negative thoughts and like teflon when it comes to positive thoughts there are reasons that our brain works this way but i do not have time to go into all of that in this response so it is just important to remember we have to work at positive thinking actually pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories  this will help the mind reinforce positive thought streams and help reduce negative thought streams over time if a scary thought arises try to replace it with a happy experience for at least a couple of moments and see if that helps reduce the negative charge connected with that scary thought

106,how can i get my fiancé to notice me again,hello it does not feel good when it seems that your partner no longer cares or cares less for you especially if your feelings have not changed it can be scary frustrating and lonely have you tried talking to him about your concerns i would suggest to start there there may be several reasons for his actions some of which may have nothing to do with how he feels for you learning about what is going on for him will likely answer your questions and depending on his response may cause some relief when initiating conversations about subjects that are sensitive there are a few things that you want to remember tell him how you are feeling and what you are experiencing rather than blaming him or telling him what he is doing wrong avoid using extreme black and white language  for example you may say something such as i feel confused that we are rarely intimate and i am wondering if you have also noticed this change versus you are never intimate with me anymore do not be afraid to ask him questions you deserve to know what is going on as his behavior is effecting your well being i like to ask openended questions instead of yes and no questions it allows for more clarity and deeper explanation lastly ask yourself what part you play in the recent changes does he feel that you have been distant does he need something from you let him know that you are willing to work things out as a team if communication attempts fail seeing a couple's therapist can be a great benefit having an objective party to coach you through this difficut time can give you the support that will create lasting changes in your relationshipbest of luck to you
107,how can i get my husband to listen to my needs and talk to me,it can be hard for husbands to hear that their wife is unhappy  by nature men tend to be more of the fix it type  so if they are sad they fix it  if their wife is sad they fix it  he may feel helpless to help you and that may be why he is saying those things to you  it is not that he does not care or that he does not take them seriously he might just have no idea how to help  i would start by making an appointment to talk with a therapist about your sadness  meeting with a therapist may help you to learn some tools and strategies that can help you to manage some of the sadness you are feeling  a therapist can also help you to gain some understanding and insight into why you might be experiencing sadness  depression is not something you have to sit with therapy can help  once your husband sees that you are being proactive in addressing your sadnessdepression he will probably be more open to listening to you and supporting you  he might start to have ideas and input on how you two can work together to change some of the situations or things that might be holding you bakc

122,how can i have a better relationship with my mom,the best way to work on a relationship is for both people to engage with the problem and start communicating with each other more effectively  one of the hardest things about this however is getting both people within the relationship to recognize that they are both responsible for the successes and failures within the relationship and remove all the allornothing blame the best style of communication is open and asking for clarification why not try asking your mother why this particular fightsituation is eliciting such an angry response  often the simple act of expressing that we do not understand the other persongs point of view can open the doors to better levels of communication the hardest part is trying to remain humble as we seek out that clarification and avoid the blaming language we are so used to using in such times

126,how can i help my daughter with her severe depression and her obsessive form of thinking,your instinct to help your daughter is naturalhow you proceed depends a lot on whether she recognizes she has a psychological and emotional problem or if only you see this from observing heralso her age matters a lot in what way would be most likely to succeed in addressing the problems you describeif you and your daughter have different opinions as to whether or not she has problems and she is above the legal age of when you have authority over her life then you can only suggest to her that therapy may benefit herif your daughter is in your legal control then you can locate a counselor nearby discuss your situation with that person and depending on the outcome you would be within your parenting right to take your daughter to a counselorstarting therapy without willingness to do so is risky  the person may feel resentful enough to not participate   and sometimes the counselor is skillful enough to find a path to your daughter or any patient's selfinterest and engage them in therapyfamily counseling regardless of your daughter's age is another way to bring your concerns to your daughter's attention in a therapy environment in which a counselor would be able to help distinguish the seriousness of your daughter's psychological problem from simply a difference in viewpoints between you and your daughter in how to handle certain situationsalso if you believe your daughter is a threat to herself then instead of this slower route get in touch with the emergency psychological assessment service in your town for a more immediate response
127,how can i help my fiancé accept and let go of my past,one of the sometimes difficult things about being in a relationship is the fact that you can make goals for yourself but you cannot make goals for your partner if your fiancé wants to learn to live more in the present and learn to let go of the past or move in a different direction you can certainly assist him but you cannot independently make it happeni wonder if both of you would be willing to have a discussion where he is able to explain to you what he is experiencing and you are able to listen for five 10 15 minutes in a way that is not blaming or pointing fingers or asking him to change but just listening so you can have more details and ask questions that you may have about what certain things mean when it feels like to to him when this is discussed etc at that point maybe he would willing to listen to your thoughts on the subject as wellalso if he wants to make a change it may be helpful to see a therapist who specializes in working with couples sometimes changes such as these require a great deal of personal awareness and there can be quite a bit of emotions attached so it is often helpful to have someone there to assistit may also be nice to have a discussion where you consider what makes you feel valued appreciated special or loved and also consider what makes your fiancé feel that way
128,how can i help my girlfriend,you are probably not going to like my answeryour question says a lot about what you want rather than what she wants or what may be best for her sometimes what's best for a person is the hardest thing to do and may be completely opposite of what you wantaddictions do not happen in a vacuum if you have had any experience with addicts at all then i am sure you have heard the term enabler a lot of the times when people think they are helping they are actually enabling the addict to continue their selfdestructive behavior tough love and clear boundaries are needed in a lot of situations but especially with addictions family and friends are often the biggest contributing factor to someone choosing to usedrink continuing to do so or relapsing back into ityou said she recently quit you said she is depressed she wants to move when a person receives counseling for addictions they are encouraged to make changes like this they need to break the habit and this means removing people from their lives at times it means moving to new locations anything that may trigger a relapse needs to be identified and removed not only that but the addict needs to do a lot of personal reflection to figure out why they usedrink in the first place and not only break the physical addiction to it but deal with whatever is the root cause that led them to use in the first place she may need some time alone to figure out who she is as a person time to make some decisions for herself and do what she needs to do to be healthydo not pressure her to stay let her have the freedom to do what she needs to do if she stays the decision needs to be hers and hers alone it does not need to be made under pressure that will only lead to resentment support her but do not try to change her or make her do anything especially for selfish reasons let her go it sounds like she needs some time to focus on herself right now it would not be a bad idea for you to do the same
129,how can i help my husband after a suicide attempt,i am thankful to read your husband found care and that his suicide attempt was not successful   while he was hospitalized and prior to his release your husband would have been provided in writing a selfcare action plan this typically includes things like committing to a contract 'not to harm' and what to do if he felt overwhelmed by his anger depression and hopelessness  additionally his protocol would have provided instructions for his taking medication as directed having a followup appointment with his psychiatristpsychologistclinical social worker and participating in some form of small group support  if your husband's struggling as you describe and you are feeling overwhelmed or frightened for his safety i would encourage you to seek immediate assistance
130,how can i help my kids get along,that is a good question unfortunately there is no generic answer with this one kids fight for different reasons  wanting attention wanting respect feeling jealous wanting space and to be left alone or a whole bunch of other reasons regardless of the underlying motivations for fighting most conflicts result from misunderstandings and assumptions about the motivations of others and one of the best ways to start figuring out what is going on is to sit them down and have some conversations with them these conversations should be centred on getting a better understanding of why they are angry with each other and really understanding them it is important that they each know that you are committed to understanding their experience rather than simply sitting them down and lecturing them about what they are doing wrong the more they are able to understand each other and feel understood the more likely they will be cooperative and considerate of each other one exercise for doing this that can be very helpful is active listening where one person speaks and the other person reflects back what they heard the other person say and then checks for understanding this is hard to do but it often illuminates where the misunderstandings and assumptions are if this does not work it may be time to get a family therapist or counsellor involved who can help facilitate dialogue and resolve conflict

136,how can i keep a long distance relationship going,hello you are asking a very good question about how to sustain a longdistance relationship although maintaining a longdistance relationship has its challenges with the proper communication commitment and understanding many longdistance couples are able to thrive and maintain a close connection without knowing more about the complicated nature of your relationship i wonder whether your boyfriend has given you reason not to trust him that makes afraid that he will find someone else has he cheated on you in the past and has shown romantic interest to another person that made you fear losing him  or is your thought just a fear but not based on evidence knowing that distinction is important because if it is the latter you may benefit from refocusing on the wonderful qualities about your partner that makes you feel good about him and the relationship rather than focusing on the unknown or uncertainty of the future the more you focus on what if situations the more you may feel anxious about a reality that is not accurate and make you act in ways that are insecure however if there is reason for you to question his fidelity you may have to speak to your boyfriend about how to build trust in the context of a longdistance relationship to help the conversation you may need to consider what you may need to experience or receive as support to feel safe in the relationship to build trust is that you wish him to contact you regularly or to include you more in his life or to make a clear commitment for many of my clients in my private practice that may include talking to their partner often and using a variety of modalities including text phone and skype it is hard to believe in a relationship when you never talk to your partner and it is hard to build a relationship when you do not know what's going on in your partner's life other times it is making sure they talk often to their longdistance partner so that they can participate in each others lives and to feel their presence regular communication understanding and caring is the key to sustaining any relationship but this is especially true for longdistance ones dr virginia chowwwwpsychologyresourceca

142,how can i love myself,i agree you need more care and support no one deserves to feel alone or like they hate themselves we are all wonderful imperfect complicated people and we are at our best when we are all helping each other i am glad you wrote this question because a lot of people have this feeling sometimes i can tell that you are smart because you seem to sense that the two things you wrote about are connectedyou not being yourself and then how you felt when your grandma died when grandma died you needed and deserved extra love and support but the people around you did not seem to give it to you maybe my hunch is that they wanted to but that they did not know how much you needed it or what you needed exactly the older you get the more you will have to take charge of letting people know what you need maybe this is one of the suckier parts of being mature but that is how it works when you started middle school it sounds like you changed you got more quiet right that must have felt weird to not be acting like yourself it sounds like fear tricked you into thinking people would not like you fear can be silly so then fear got you to not show yourself and when we do not show ourselves people cannot see who we are they do not know us as well and then they do not know what we need and they cannot care for us as well either fear of not being liked isolated you from the people who love you it does that to a lot of us so where you are at right now is because of what fear did to you and also because when grandma died you were already isolated so people could not see your pain and know that you needed support there's a simple solution but you would have to be brave enough to look fear in the face and say get off my back you are not helping me by telling me lies can you be brave enough to go back to your old louder self if you talk to the people closest to youtell them what you think and how you feel then they will be able to give you the care that you want and deserve i wish you well as you try this

173,how can i talk to my psychologist about upping my dose of xanax,hello and thank you for your question while counselors work closely with medical providers and sometimes have discussions about medications with people we rarely make recommendations about how much or what type of medication a person should be taking this is because prescribing and advising on medication is out of our scope of practice the only exception would be if a counselor is also a physician nurse practitioner physiciangs assistant etc having said that i certainly understand that anxiety is a real serious problem that many folks struggle with if you are currently not in therapy to help you with these panic attacks you should consider it medications can be helpful for anxiety and medications like xanax may help for immediate relief but they do nothing to deal with the root of anxiety and may not help with anxiety longterm therapists who have experience in exposure therapies would be good people to start with exposure therapy has good outcomes for people with anxiety disorders and panic attacks if you are interested in speaking with your provider about the xanax i think explaining it the way you did on here is just fine the provider will then decide if they feel comfortable increasing your medication please remember that medical providers are not trying to give people a hard time medications like xanax really are highly addictive the more you take the more you may feel you need the more often you may feel you need to use it depending on the frequency and amount of use some people suffer serious withdrawal symptoms when they do not take the medication it is a good idea to talk to medical provider about all of those things so that you can partner on right course of action to manage this anxiety i certainly hope that you get some relief i know anxiety is awfulrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc

176,how can i train myself to stop eating when i am full,hello i am so glad you decided to write in today this is such a great question and i am sure many others will relate to exactly what you are describing there are a few different ways we can look at in understanding your concern first i think it is important to understand food is just food food is meant to nourish our bodies provide us with energy and yes sometimes reserved for special occasions and celebrations but in many cultures we place a lot of emphasis on food we have food at every gathering and every celebration what's more people have come to almost expect food to be present at any and every gettogether and if it is not well then forget about it i see this time and time again with my clients donuts appear in the office and it is almost like donuts have never been there before must eat one  however we need to remind ourselves that this occurrence or similar ones will not be the last time we can enjoy this particular food it is likely the office donuts have happened before and they will be there again on another day during these moments i like to have my clients employ a stopandthink method stopandthink about your goals before you eat is this donut getting you where you want to be also i have my clients ask themselves how special is this donut if the donut really is a special donut then now might be a time to have the donut but if not it would be wise to pass and wait until that special donut another aspect we need to remember about food is to think about what we are getting from overindulging or overeating are you trying to drown out other emotions are you trying to feel better and the food gives you that feeling for a brief moment what else is going on this can be determined by utilizing what we describe as a thought record a thought record involves tracking and identifying thoughts and feelings associated with food triggers by targeting the emotions we can then determine where they are coming from as well as how to decipher them a therapist can also help you with understanding your emotions related to food and will be helpful in assisting you with the thought recordthe most important thing to remember is that food addiction can be a real problem for a lot of people if food is taking over your life and you are preoccupied and overwhelmed with knowing where to start please seek out help binge eating is the most common eating disorder and impacts the lives of thousands there are lots of free resources and information on my website at wwwmaddenwellnesskycom in addition i offer individual coaching and counseling through my website and i would love to help amber

180,how can my marriage be fixed,one key factor to consider is are you able to repair after your arguments it seems from your question that repair is lacking after any disagreement or argument when couples are able to repair after an argument they have an opportunity to learn more about each other's needs moving forward i am also curious if you are having the same type of arguments over and over if you are stuck in a particular pattern and can start recognizing what happens between you when this pattern happens then you can start to name it once you name it then you can take a break to cool off and come back to each after your nervous system has had a chance to calm down  the key here though is to make sure you have a plan in place  when things are good between you  an agreement between you that when you both start to get escalated you will name it or have an agreed upon code word to signal you do not want to continue this cycle and then agree to cool off and come back together at a later time that way when this is enacted during an argument nobody feels abandoned during the cool off time rather both partners know they will return at a time when they can truly hear each other and hear their needs

182,how can you get back to my old self,sometimes when we fight a lot with our partner it becomes more uncomfortable to share emotions because it feels like it will lead to another flight or disagreementyou could try having a conversation when you are not fighting and starting it out by saying that you would like to discuss something important to you and see if your fiancée is open to thatsomething else is that you could have an agreement that if one of you is having a really strong emotions in a difficult conversation and would like to break from the conversation you could agree that you will say that you would like a timeout and will come back to discuss the issue in a certain amount of time and then try to resume the discussion the reason this can work is it can give you a chance to calm down and then still go back to the discussion rather than not talking about it again this only works if both of you agree to that before something starts though

193,how do i choose between two guys,hi there wow this sounds like a sticky situation however i’m here to help guide you through this decision first and foremost you must ask yourself if you ever loved your sons’ father or was it a situation to where you two got pregnant and stayed together for the child it’s very common to stay with your partner when a child is involved regardless if love is involved or not because “it’s the right thing to do” right well not entirely although staying with your partner because you have a child together may seem right in fact it hurts the child in the long run if you are not love with your partner you will show distance unhappiness sadness possibility of frequent arguments and cheating when a child grows up in the home and witnesses these types of emotions & behaviors it is unhealthy as heshe will expect their own relationships to be such as a responsible adult you are supposed to be there to shape and model the future for your child just remember what you do your child will model secondly do not sell yourself short from love everyone deserves to be happy and to have someone to share their love and intimacy with however being in love with someone you have never seen before can be very risky honestly that sounds like lust and the longing of love humans have needs and when people are unhappy in their current relationship they often seek out what they need if you decide to pursue the second relationship i would suggest setting up an outing with a friend or two in order to get to know this person as there are a lot of scammers these days finally i am not convinced that this has anything to do with choosing between two guys this seems as if you are making a decision to end the relationship with your child’s father or not you should ask yourself if you were in love with your child’s father first off if you were you would have never sought after love i hope this was helpful for you and i hope i was able to shed a different light on your situation take care of yourself

197,how do i cope with never being good enough,hello and let me say first what a great question there are so many people putting forth their 100% everyday and often times do not get the credit they deserve without being able to fully understand where you are question is coming from i think there are a couple of different ways to look at this questionfirst i think it is important for us to consider the message being sent by those in your life stating that you are not good enough is that actually what they said or is this just what you heard sometimes because of our own selfdoubts and fears we skew and misinterpret the messages we receive from others again listen to the message being sent and attempt to remain objective is the message being sent coming from a place of love or concern if so have an honest and open communication with that individual about what your concerns are regarding the amount of energy and time you are spending on being good enough explore with them how you feel you'r already giving your bestif the person is unwilling to work at understanding this concern you have then it may be time to explore the relationship some relationships we engage in can be toxic especially if the other person is toxic it may be they have their own stuff going on and they feel the need to constantly put others down to make themselves feel better if you are in the direct path of this individual then it serves to reason you will probably be in the direct fire as well explore whether or not you want this relationship to continue in your life if it is a relationship that must continue then work on what you will do to distance yourself from their toxicity or their problems until they are willing to work on these issues for themselves then it may be necessary to find an exit strategy such as leaving the room or simply refusing to engage in the conversation another perspective of this question is exploring the reason why it is important for you to satisfy the expectations of these other individuals no one will ever be 100% good enough for everyone every single person has their own set of expectations in themselves and expectations in others it would be impossible to satisfy all of those expectations for every single person in our lives the question becomes what is it within you that feels the need to meet these expectations there is most likely a part of you yourself as an individual that feels less than and feels as if you yourself are not good enough it then becomes impossible to every feel good enough for others because it is really you you are trying to feel good enough for if you already feel as if you are doing everything you can do to be at your best version of yourself then really work on letting go of the rest no one is perfect and striving for perfection in our lives only creates more anxiety and stress find a middle ground in which you are happy with your accomplishments and your daily goals and learn to let go of what's left after all tomorrow is a new day and you can work on more of your goals tomorrowi recommend doing this by finding a mantra a statement or phrase you can repeat to yourself anytime you start to feel that sense of stress and pressure from striving for perfection the mantra can remind you to let go of this expectation you have for yourself or that others have for you so you can also let go of the stress and anxiety surrounding the expectation i leave you with one of my favorite quotes that perhaps you can use as your mantra no one can make you feel inferior without your consent   eleanor roosevelt

222,how do i find out the cause of my depression and anxiety,it could be really helpful to see a counselortherapist about your increasing depressionpanic symptoms finding out the cause of depressionanxiety is not always as straightforward as it seems since both issues tend to become patterns we engage in rather than solely related to a specific triggerreason for example if i am feeling down about a particular circumstance in my life then i start seeing life through this lens of feeling down and typically i will start to see a lot more that i get down about and it can really build very quickly on itself same with anxiety obviously this is a very simplified example and it can be very difficult to see how the pattern is maintained but that is where working with a counselortherapist comes in i would be curious about whether you can start to notice the initial sensations of panic and if you can continue to maintain awareness of the actual physical sensations even better if you can talk yourself through the sensations you are feeling  such as saying to yourself okay i am breathing really rapidly and my heart is racing now my palms are sweaty and my chest is feeling really tight reminding yourself that it is just your body's reaction to stress and while it might be overreacting right now you are okay and eventually it will go away i highly recommend the sam for anxiety management app for the anxiety piece and i would not be surprised if addressing the anxiety helped to address some of the depression too

233,how do i get my husband to listen to me,thanks for writing there are many different house of things that may be helpful here i can give you some general ideas but if some of these things do not get you to where you would like to go consider seeing a therapist who specializes in couplesremember that you can only guarantee change in yourself you can ask him to make changes but you cannot control whether he does or not you can control your reactions and what you do about your own thoughts feelings and actions in the relationshipif you are going to talk about something important or you really want him to listen first ask whether this is a good timetry to talk to him without blaming fingerpointing or asking him to change be mindful of your packaging by that i mean that you may have a very important message that you are trying to get across if you able to say it in a way that is clear and wrapped in such a way that he can hear what you are actually saying that is helpful if you are talking in ways that are angry or as i sometimes say wrapped in spikes that can be difficult to hear and receive rather than hearing what you are actually trying to get across he may just hear the fact that you are angryif your husband is able to listen to you andor restate what you are saying and get it right or close to right let him know what that feels like to you and how important it isif you are asking questions try to avoid why question and use what makes how when where who instead questions starting with why can not only be difficult to answer but can also trigger a lot of emotions that some people are not ready to deal with right awayalso keep in mind that listening and being able to reflect what you are saying does not imply agreement this may be something that would be good to discuss with your husband – just because he is hearing what you are saying does not mean that he is agreeing with youlastly but importantly some people really do not know how to listen effectively there are people who just are not taught to do that until much later in their lives sometimes listening to someone can actually be very vulnerabilityproducing it may be helpful to ask your husband if he knows what makes him struggle with being able to listen if you notice that he is really struggling

271,how do i learn to let go of past problems and live one day at a time,"staying present is an attitude most of us aspire
to and most of us have to work at it—certainly at first i’m here to tell you
that living in the now or being mindful is a skill anyone can learn unfortunately
the only way to do it is to do it what a paradox but there are plenty of
other skills that we are not born with walking on stilts riding a bike
swimming and driving a car are good examples you can’t learn them by reading about
themhaving said that i can recommend two books on
the subject eckhart tolle’s the power of
now and david richo’s when the past
is present richo asks that we don’t beat ourselves up about dwelling on
past events this is nature’s way of reminding us that we have unfinished
business but while we are attended to the wounds and confusion that litter our earlier lives we can prepare to inhabit the expanded present that awaits ushe offers three helpful steps to making any important life
changestep one hold in awareness the behavior
belief attitude or characteristic you want to change in yourself and how you
want to be different awareness is the opposite of distraction and stuffingstep two live as if you have
already made the change this is hard and takes courage but you can do it
ride that bike—even if for a foot or twostep three be persistent
just as twoyearolds are able to walk
confidently after hundreds of hours of practice you’ll be able to stay in the
here and now as long as you want after trying and failing many many times"
272,how do i let go of someone who continues to hurt me,hello and thank you for your question boy ending relationships is tough is not it sometimes it is tough even when we are 100% sure that it is the right thing to doi am going to give you some of my thoughts and hopefully some colleagues will add some others one of the things that i want to point out is that letting go is not really a thing in other words it is not really something you can reach out and grab it is more of a process this is good news because you do not necessarily have to be at the end of the process to end an unhealthy relationship we just have to accept that there will be feelings that come up even after the relationship is over for example someone can end an unhealthy relationship today but then be reminded of the good times on what would have been their anniversary this could make the person very sad they may even regret ending the relationship for a little while it would important then for the person to remind themselves why the relationship needed to end and that they are healthier because of it this is relevant for you it is hard to walk away from a relationship we fear all kinds of things including being single sometimes it is helpful to compare what you are getting out of the relationship to what you want from a relationship it is helpful to be honest about what we have given up for an unhealthy relationship it is fine to admit uncertainly about ending things it is okay to be afraid it is okay to have moments of doubt and sadness along with a dash of guilt and even with all of that someone can still leave if it is the healthiest thing for them they can have sadness later on and still not go backit sounds like you are feeling responsible for making sure he is okay because of this divorce the truth is that there is not necessarily a perfect time to end any relationship there would be no guarantee that he would be doing any better after the divorce sometimes not making decisions stresses us out a lot more than making a decision and living with the consequences both good and bad you may be at that crossroads be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
273,how do i let go of the abuse my dad showed me,i am so sorry to hear that you are struggling  getting to know yourself after a trauma and learning to trust yourself can feel terrifying  i would encourage you to seek out a trauma therapist who can work with you slowly and at your pace  you are not your trauma  you are good and you are whole  please seek out the support of a therapist who sees that in you
274,how do i make my relationship with my girlfriend better,maybe you can start with having 15 minutes per week that you know you will be spending time with each other  because this much time could be scheduled ahead of time at least you would know there was that time that was set aside that may also help you to rekindle some conversations between youas far as your little fights consider spending five minutes with one of you talking about one issue that is a concern and the other partner asking questions that are openended and listening as an investigative reporter to try to learn more about what the other person is experiencing then once the partner who started speaking thinks the listening partner is understanding where they are coming from switch it is also good to restate what you think you are hearing then you know what each other is truly following about this also remember that following or understanding what someone is saying does not imply agreement just that you are recognizing what they are saying and able to see where they are coming fromalso consider noticing what makes you feel valued special loved or appreciated think of the same for your girlfriend this could be a great discussion to have as well
275,how do i make myself happy without someone who made me happy,hello so someone made you happy but is no longer around i am sure that feels devastating as a counselor i usually have to ponder this kind of thought because it lends itself to suggesting that happiness comes from the external rather than the internal side of a persongs life happiness is formed within ourselves all the external trappings of happiness are usually quite fleeting and temporary even relationships fo not last forever if we get to a place where we are reliant and dependent on those around us to create happiness in our lives then we lose the opportunities for us to do it ourselves we are entirely capable of finding ways to be happy sometimes this entails working out issues that are holding us back from reaching a place of peace or resolution to a specific problemwhat i would offer to you is to find ways in which you can develop happiness for yourself what do you like about your life as it is right now what can you do to create change in your life to increase your happiness these kinds of questions can be valuable to you as you seek out ways to make happiness an internal rather than an external event mourning the loss of a social connection  is part of the grieving process but it is not permanent it is a path to healing and moving forward from this you can seek out new sources of happiness i encourage you to remember that happiness is independent of the external experience you have in the world happiness is an expression of the internal feelings so that will be the source or the font of positive emotion from which you really draw if you are lacking in happiness then it becomes important to examine why that is and what you can do about it to promote selfcare seeking out a professional counselor can also be a good option as you move through the griefloss process and examine the reasons happiness is not in greater supplyi wish you happiness for every day of your lifebest wishes

277,how do i manage my anger,first off it is great that you recognize that some changes need to be made it is also really good that you understand where the source of your anxiety and stress comes from fortunately there are many self help books and internet sources that provide free tools to help you cope with life's obstacles including anger management there are several strategies that you can try to help control your anger but the ones that i would recomend first are the following1 try a different way of communicating with your parents since arguing with them is a great source of anger for you learning more effective ways of communicating with them will likely be of great benefit choose a time to talk with them about heated issues when everyone is calm and emotions are not heightened use i phrases by telling them how the arguments effect you as opposed to placing blame on them validate what you hear your parents say in order to allow them to know that you understand their point of view2 when you feel yourself becoming angry take a break simply excuse yourself from the situation find a quiet place to be by yourself and do some deep breathing close your eyes slowly count to four as you inhale and exhale even slower counting to 6 focus on nothing except for your breathing and do this for 5 minutes3 stop any negative thoughts in their tracks often times when we get upset we catastrophize and do not see things clearly when you catch yourself thinking negatively stop the thoughts and ask yourself if your thinking is logical and rational if you cannot find much or any evidence that your thoughts are valid then let them go and replace them with realistic logical thoughts4 finally find a friend or someone to talk to andor keep a journal keeping your emotions to yourself will not help you being able to express your feelings and problem solve will allow for some relief when feeling sad or angryi wish you all the best

292,how do i repair my friendship,this takes time i do not know how long it has been but perhaps if your friend is willing to discuss other things with you for a little while you could discuss this at some point in the futurehopefully the true intentions will become apparent also i encourage you to look at how this is affecting you and how you feel about yourself as well if it was meant to be a joke and it did not work that is not entirely your faulti wonder how you could forgive yourself for what happenedare you able to seek what you meant to do compared to what actually happeneddo you notice that not everything that has happened here is in your controldo you recognize that even though you would like things to be better if your friend is not ready or willing you are trying to do your part to make it rightmaybe everyone who iswas involved in this can talk together all at the same time to set straight what is truth and what was misunderstoodi wonder if you can think of your own positive attributes and look at what truly exists within you rather than just one your friend is able to see right nowthis can be really difficult for multiple reasons not the least of which is that it involves more than just you so it is important to focus on the idea that you can ask these other people who were involved to discuss it but that is ultimately up to thembest wishes for looking at the positive parts of yourself and your friendships
293,how do i save my marriage,hello it sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage i cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now marriages take lots of work and often the only examples we tend to have are of those we saw when we were young  good bad or indifferent there are no easy answers to your questions and i will not presume that my response to you will be the linchpin that heals all your pain but i can maybe give some thoughts and reflections first and foremost cut yourself some slack no one is perfect we fail more often than we succeed but in the end we learn and that learning helps us grow yes you are right the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good and need to stop you probably are doing more harm than good in that regard and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor seeing a therapist for yourself and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach you have issues that you need to resolve that while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life they are separate from your marriage in many respectsjoining a marriage support group can also be helpful you can find these through local counseling resources sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful if you belong to a religious or spiritual community then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for youlastly parents are imperfect yepits true they had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage we limp along and do our best having said that we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us the bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life both with ourselves and toward other people so this becomes a guiding principle in our actions it may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit  i am sure that remains to be seen but either way you both must be involved in saving it if only one of you cares then 100% of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person that is not fair so be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants and work to create an amicable solution all of this said seek out supportive friends and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life one way or the other you will benefit from itbe well

295,how do i shake selfdoubt about sex,i first wonder what your anxiety or fear connects to i do not know whether it is about sex itself or about ideas of worthiness or feeling desirablethere is also a difference between having selfdoubt about the actual physicality of having sex or having doubts about whether you want to have sex with a particular personhaving sex can lead to feelings of great vulnerability if your partner is someone you trust consider discussing what it is that comes up for you around the issue of sex this is the certain things that your partner would be willing to do that and the ease your discomfort like staying with you for some time before and after sexual interactionsanother idea to consider is spending time with your partner and using nonsexual touch for each other and communicating very clearly about what you like and do not like some people like to be spoken to during physical touch and other people do not all of this can be part of your discussions when you feel comfortable with that you could move into sexual touch in this manner and actually look at what you do and do not like you may also consider discussing things that are totally offlimits for you all the time and things for which you would like warning or awareness before they happen there are really a number of different ways to work on becoming more comfortable if you trust your partner and if your concern is about sex itselfif this feels pretty structured it is initially generally the idea is to learn more about each other and yourselves and then the process becomes much more naturalif the concern relates more to selfesteem related sex consider asking your partner to list several things that he or she likes about you even if you do not necessarily see yourself in the same light consider that this is how your partner sees you so these are some of the things that make you attractive to them if this is difficult for you to sort out on your own consider seeing a therapist with experience working with couples or relationships

309,how do i talk to my girlfriend about my anxiety from her exes,talking about it would probably be helpful if you are both in a place where you can decide when is best to talk about something that is important it may also be helpful to ask if you could talk for two or three minutes to make a point and then have space for her to talk for the same amount of time you can adjust the timing for what works for both of you after one of you is talking perhaps you could restate what you have heard the person say this can lessen confusioni know you say that she avoids it it might be a good place to start talking about it – to see what makes her avoid it it could be that she thinks any discussion about them is going to lead to an argument or you saying that she cannot talk to them i do not know how you typically react when you are jealous but if you can discuss talking about this in a way that you are both open to hearing what the other person is experiencing that may be helpful as well
310,how do i tell a girl that i crossdress,thanks for asking this question i think the most important part of what you mentioned was that you do it because it makes you happy for that reason i would encourage you to keep doing what makes you happyas far as telling girls or keeping it a secret i do not really think that it is necessarily one or the other at least not the first time that you meet in other words one part of your decisionmaking could be whether it is something that you always want to address in the first date or perhaps something that you address after you have known each other for a couple of meetings the answer to that question may also change depending on who you are dating i would imagine that each person that you are with mainly due to a different decision this was when to disclose this it sounds like this is an important part of you so i would think that if you were going to date someone longterm you would want them to know about the most important parts of you including thati also encourage you to remember that if you meet someone who is not comfortable with this that does not mean that there is anything wrong with what you are doing but rather something that the other person is in some way deciding not to continue learning about or choosing to have someone they are dating like to crossdressi would also ask you to consider this are the people who you say this to expecting it my guess is that the answer is probably not along with that are they going to have questions i would imagine soare you comfortable answering questionsi wonder if you could figure out yourself or with friends how you would answer these sorts of questionswhat exactly is crossdressingdoes that change the gender that you are attracted towhat does it mean to youwhy is it important to youand what you want your listening person to know about you related to crossdressingthere could even be ways that you can start the conversation by asking them to be open to listen to you and ask questions about what they are thinking before they make any quick decisions about you or the relationshipi certainly hope that you find the right person for you i imagine that having this conversation could be stressful especially considering the idea that you have had some negative reactions in the past remember that talking this through with a therapist could be very helpful
311,how do i tell my boyfriend i wanna be with him but not in a relationship,it sounds like you are pulling away instead of being honest if you really want to be with him why not now if you do not have time for a relationship why are you dating at alli do not understand the whole phasing out thing that people do these days  i get the sense that this relationship is not working for you but for some reason you are stopping yourself from being honest with yourself and him and just ending it in the early stage of a relationship  if it does not feel fabulous it is a good idea to move on it is not personal you do not owe this person anything they deserve someone who's totally into them and you are doing him no favors by hanging on to something that is not amazing or giving him hope that it might work better in the future sometime you do not have to slowly bow out it actually creates more hurt than gentle honesty maybe people do not know how to say iti have decided not to continue with this i wish you the best life is too short
312,how do i tell my elderly mother that i can’t stay for long visits,good observation on your part to distinguish that your feelings in relation to your mom are not necessarily connected to the way she handles her part of the relation toward youhas your mom usually ignored your opinions and wishes in relating to youif prior to the onset of alzheimer's she never examined her way of relating to you and if both of you have never had an open conversation about your sense of feeling hurt by her attitudes and manner with you then the relationship between you and your mom will change in ways other than rational dialogueshe may continue ignoring or overlooking your wishes because she is been stuck in this attitude for most of your lifethe good news for you about this is realizing that who you are and your way of relating to your mom has very little to do with the way she relates to youthis is a more profound disappointment because it shows that her disconnect from you has been for longer than when the alzheimer's beganyou can however feel a little more free knowing that you are not deserving of being ignored
313,how do i tell my parents that i think i have some mental problems,if you have already been diagnosed with attentiondeficit disorder and obsessivecompulsive disorder can you go back to the people who diagnosed you with those thingsit may be that your parents would be open to you talking with someone because it sounds like you have done this in the past i do not know whether you have a specific reason that you are thinking they may have some hesitation but if you are comfortable saying that you would really like to talk to someone because you are feeling sad or anxious  that may be a way to start the process as for how you tell them about the fact that you have harmed yourself in the past and used to be suicidal a therapist may be able to work together with you to discuss the best way to tell them about thati am not sure if you have told anyone about what you have been experiencing but if you have some support there perhaps they would be able to give you feedback about ways to talk with your parents as wellyou mentioned that sometimes you hear voices this can happen for a variety of reasons but if the voices that you hear are giving you directions and you feel as though you might follow them that would be a time to ask for immediate help before you follow through with what they are telling you perhaps by calling 8002738255 they may be able to connect you with local resources and they can definitely talk with you in the moment that you call

315,how do i tell my parents that i am gay,hello and thank you for your question this is one of those times when you wish you could assure someone that everything will go perfectly but unfortunately i cannot do that there is no way of knowing how parents might respond until you tell them the truth is that people have come out to their parents in many different ways some have told their parents directly some drop hints some have had others tell their parents etc the only right way to come out is the one that you choose the one that feels right to you that is the best way some people decide not to come out and some wait for a very long time both of these things are okay coming out is deeply personal and there can be real consequences to someone's emotional health and safety if they tell the wrong person that is why it should only be done when you are ready when you feel that you have the emotional and personal support that you need to take the risk sometimes people can feel pressured to come out but i encourage you to do it in your own time the truth is there is a spectrum of how people's parents react to this kind of news on one end you may have the parents who shut a person out and are abusive and on the opposite side you may have parents that are totally okay with it and throw you a coming out party most parents are going to fall somewhere in the middle it is important to remember that their feelings may change over time many parents struggle at first but they love their kids and get better with it over time if you decide to tell them consider taking someone along to support you plan ahead on what you want to say it can be an emotional time so do what you need to do to take care of yourself if you need to leave you do not have to stay anywhere where someone is being cruel to you i wish you well and good luckrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc

323,how does counseling end,there are typically three reasons why therapy is terminated1 client has met therapy goals2 client is not progressing 3 therapist is not a good fit for clientin order to properly assess whether therapy is helping and what progress is being made the therapist needs to have ways of consistently checking in with clients sessionsbysession to determine what is helping what is not and where the client is at in relation to their original therapy goals when a client has met their goals that is a good time to end counselling sessions unless the client has new goals or simply wants to checkin periodically to make sure that they are still on track  when a client is not progressing and feedback has been taken and attempts have been made to make the therapy more helpful for the client but to no avail than it is considered unethical to continue to work with the client in these circumstances referring out to another therapist who may be a better fit is a good idea

341,i am 18 years old with a baby on the way,well as far as your boyfriend sounds like he has received advice from others that is not wise advice  leaving is not the answer after a big argument as you mentioned  however this is not surprising to me based on his possible age and maturity level  having a baby is a lifetime responsibility and there are very few who handle this or who realizes that it requires one to step their game up  this is something that he has to realize and be encouraged by his parents or a mature adult to do  hopefully someone who has better advice will talk to him and he will listenas for you  how do you handle this situation is your questionyou do what you have to do to prepare for your baby with or without him  a lot can happen in four years and you do not have time are not required and cannot wait to see what will happen with him  you have a life to prepare for  to feed to protect and to love  can you tell your baby to wait i do not want to deal with you now i need to mature i will be back to see you later hope you will be fine  nope   as i always say you are not alone because there is someone somewhere going through the same or similar thing  develop healthy friendshipswhether with family friends or new people who may enter your life  your support system will grow and life will go onwith or with him  stay focus on you and your baby
342,i am 20 and miserable,hello and thank you for your question it certainly sounds like you do not like how things are going here are a few thoughts and ideas1 if you have not seen a primary care provider in a while you may want to there are health conditions that can affect your mood and energy levels even at your age it does not hurt to get checked out if they find the cause they may be able to treat it and improve the symptoms in addition most primary care providers are trained to be able to manage medication for patients who have mild moderate and sometimes severe depression so do not be surprised if your primary care doctor offers to put you on an antidepressant if they diagnose you with depression medication is not the only way to treat depression but sometimes it is necessary depending on different factors2 you may want to consider counseling since it is another effective way to treat depression a counselor will help you explore the factors that may be leading to depressive symptoms in the first place this could include thoughts behaviors beliefs life experiences and other things 3 finally to answer your question about whether these feelings are normal these symptoms could be the sign of an underlying general health or mental health condition it is important to remember that even if these symptoms are abnormal it does not mean that you are millions of people struggle with depression so remember the symptoms are the problem not you hope this helps be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
343,i am afraid of sex,these fears are completely normal almost everyone has the same fears you do to some degree especially if they lack experience men also feel far more of these fears than you realize that can helpto remember that we are all a little scared and looking for safety and approvalyou mention a partner but i am not sure if you currently have one having a partner you can trust with your fears and who you feel safe with is so important when you are really confident someone cares deeply for you this can help the fears to go away or diminish how well do you know your own body getting to know how you like to be touched and how different touches feelgetting acquainted with your body yourself firstthis can help build sexual confidence in general our partners care less about our fat and wrinkles than they care about how we make them feel in bed being a generous lover who is confident enough to put fear asideironically this is what makes you good in bed but be patient with yourself your confidence will grow with experience and that does not have to happen until you are ready there's not rush 
344,i am bipolar and have been absolutely angry for over the last year at my daughter,was either parent abusive or violent toward youyou sound to have suffered emotionally in your relationships since early in lifeone point to consider is to strive for moderation in what you offer in relationshipsa lot of what you have lived through is extreme either as victim or perpetratorif you imagine that apologizing to the custodian for the way spoke to him would calm him down do soat the very least you will be actively resolving your guilt over cussing at him and fear of his retaliation
345,i am fearful of social situations and avoiding people all together,overwhelming fear social anxiety and depression are especially painful because they make behaving constructively a challenge  but there are also lots of examples of folks who have successfully worked their way through this  so there is hope   in addition to the suggestion to visit your doctor  there are many social service agencies who provide free counseling or take medicaid  a good cbt therapist will help you look at your thinking so that you may see how you are distorting your thoughts  behavior is also important  despite how you may feel it is helpful to go out to do things that relax you   exercise diet eat well think back on the things that you used to do that helped in the past and force yourself to do these things again  i know that this seems hard but it beats the alternative does not it  of course i recommend you pick up a copy of my book living yes which will help you look at these and other ideas to help you out  i hope you get unstuck soon  mark 
346,i am in my mid40s and am currently mending a broken heart over another failed relationship,sounds like you already see what's amiss you are looking for fixeruppers when you meet these men they need you and you are filled by fixing them  and when they are fixed what do they have to give you what's your need in relationship what if you found someone who did not need fixing
347,i am paranoid that my boyfriend hiding something from me,have you spoken to him about your fears perhaps you can explain this feeling to him and let him know what might lead to feeling more secure  also it is important to trust your intuition  perhaps there are good reasons to feel concerned it may not be paranoia  it may be based in reality
348,i am very self conscious about my body,i get how you feel you wish your body looked different and you are embarrassed that you tried to make it look different and people may notice you do not say how old you are it is likely that if you are young your body will change as you mature but in general we are given the bodies we are given and i am glad to see that there may be a desire in you to accept your body the way it is you seem to want to stop disguising it bodies come in all shapes and sizes and every woman knows how it feels to struggle with accepting what her's looks like many men go through this as well although women are more often targeted with cultural messages about how we are supposed to look young people often believe that others are noticing and judging them in fact other people are far more preoccupied with who might be judging them than whatever's going on with you i suggest you wear whatever bra you want to wear and if someone is rude enough to comment on it you can ignore them and talk about the weather or the latest pop song that you love and they will get the hint but my bet is they will not even notice 
349,i cannot focus when i am doing work even when i try to force myself to do it,yeah i get the same problem look i am not a professional but i have heard a few things a powernap can help just a half hour of sleep can clear your mind and let you refocus also brain activity increases with physical exertion just walk around for a minute and get your brain working and that will help you reach the task at hand taking breaks it totally okay try to have something to do in between that you enjoy
350,i cannot leave my negative environment without leaving behind my fiancé,hi bethlehemyou have a big decision to make  i appreciate your fiancé's need to stay close to his child and be a standup dad and i am glad that you know your son needs an emotionally safe placei am a bit confused because the obvious answer seems to be that you and your fiancé would get your own place together i get that you want your dad to take care of all of you but maybe it is time to take responsibility for your own future and start building it independently of either parent i say that without knowing how old you are but if you have a child and a two year relationship you basically have declared your independence anyway  i wish you the best
351,i cheated on my husband with one of his good friends a few years ago,the issue at hand here is that you are betrayal broke his trust in order to repair your relationship you will both need to confront the infidelity and both of you will need to honor yourselves by communicating your feelings and ensuring that those feelings are heard and validated it would be really helpful to do this work with a gottman or emotionally focused couples therapist gottmangs the science of trust and what makes love last would both be helpful reference books to guide you along
352,i cheated on my partner and i do not know how to feel,i do not think there's anything that you are supposed to feel some people feel tremendously guilty when they cheat and others not at all it could be that your partner does not know about the cheating and you have not had to face hisher emotions and reactions when something we do is hiddena secretit is easier to avoid feeling guilty i wonder if you are avoiding your own emotions but let's put that question aside for now there are better questionswhat do you want do you want your marriage if not this may be why you do not feel guilty do you want to be able to sleep with your friend it is unlikely that both are possible  yes you get to do whatever you want with your bodyandthere may be consequences affairs almost always get discovered who do you want to be what kind of partner do you want to be what might your partner feel if they knew how might you feel then would you care has something happened that is affected how much you care about your partneri suggest that these other questions might be a place to start exploring it with a therapist is something to consider maybe i wish you the best as you sort it out 
353,i completely lost myself—how can i find myself again,maybe your thoughts require your attention and the best course would be to pay attention and follow themif you are in an especially stressful or uncertain time in your life then the best way through is to understand the tension you feelit keeps trying to get you to know whats going on deep within youanxiety is a sign of stress and weariness  your thoughts are a chance to simply rest and know what they would like you to knowthen when that process is finished your anxiety will no longer be necessary and will most likely leave you alone
354,i crossdress and i do not know how to feel about it,let yourself enjoy crossdressingwhat sounds in your way are whatever beliefs you gre up hearing see and absorb currentlyconcentrate on your own satisfaction and that you are doing this in a nonharming waymaybe if you branch out your interest by finding other people who enjoy crossdressing as much as you dowith any interest or activity social interaction supports it
355,i did something i cannot get over,the good news is your awareness that being violent to animals feels out of character for you   i am glad you have awareness and i am glad you are not at ease with killing frogsfairly likely that you were acting out aggressively toward the frog feelings of being on the receiving side of similar type of violencebasically you did unto the frog what someone has or to you feels like has been done to youuse your surprising finding of how strong your anger and most likely inward pain   reflect on your closest relationships and how these people treat you   it is possible you feel more hurt by someone who is close to you than you ever realizedstabbing innocent frogs is wrong  it is understandable as a way to show you how much inner pain you probably haveit is also wrong that someone close to you hurt youthe direction to go is to recognize your pain and then decide how to go about changing what is possible on your side of that or those relationship
356,i do not believe in myself anymore,congratulations on leaving your marriageit is ok and natural to feel sadness loss uncertainty in direction hurt resulting from ending the marriagepossibly what you consider pity is a combination of these feelingsbe kind and caring toward who you are since you just put yourself through a major separation and need time to clear out the old emotions that connected you to your exthere is very very little chance of him helping you since he lacks compassion and empathymore likely any help he gave would be in order to manipulate youmaybe for now your server job is ok do you have more time to concentrate on taking care of your emotionsyou were a manager once you can be a manager again when you feel ready for doing sogood luck
357,i do not feel a connection to my husband anymore,lacey i am so glad you wrote thousands of people are having this same feeling right now i am glad you are paying attention to it when you first meet someone there are all kinds of sparkly feelings and you both do and say lots of things to cement the attachment and create deep intimacy and connection then what happens is because we have that connection established we instinctively cut back on those loving behaviours because we do not have to work hard to earn their love anymore that sparkly feeling typically lasts a few years  and then it wears off a bit and you end up looking at each other thinking how come i do not feel the same anymoremostly all that this means is you have stopped doing all those loving things you used to do it is as though you filled the car with gas you have run out of gas now and you are forgetting to put more inthe first clear solution to this feeling is to bring back more of your own loving behaviours that you have cut back on act lovingly and you will likely regain those feelings talk to your partner about this it is okay to say do you remember we used to do xy and z can we do that again can i get more of the foot rubs you used to give me ask for what you want  what are your 'love languages' what are your partner's marriages need to be fed it is that simple many things get in the waychildren jobs but mostly complacency get active with your loveokay now you might read this and think that is not what's happening that is a cue to talk to someone like a therapist about your feelings people do grow and change and sometimes relationships do not fit anymore but these are huge decisions not to be made lightly i wish you happiness
358,i do not know how to communicate with my adult daughter,that sounds awful and is clearly unsustainable  there are some great answers that give some guidance about what might be an underlying condition  if all physical and mental health issues are ruled out it is time to take action  get backup from friends or family members if you need to but let your daughter know you are giving her 30 days notice  she needs to find another place to live within that time  if she wants to stay with you be clear that first she has to go with a potential to return after she has been out for a good chunk of time  once out she can prove to you and more importantly to herself that she is capable of maintaining her health and her environment  remember you are going to rule out issues that would make it impossible for her to be successful if she is in good health her staying with you and living this way is actually harming her
359,i do not know how to deal with my boyfriend's father,you are expecting reasonable behaviors from your boyfriend's fathersince the father is his your boyfriend is the person in position to speak directly with his dad about the expectations you and he have of the fatherif your boyfriend has a good relationship w his dad which is not what this sounds like then greatif your boyfriend has a stressed and tense relationship w his dad then somehow he needs to develop or be coached and encouraged by the people in his life who truly care about and know him a way to state the very reasonable standards you describe hereif all else fails then a new living space is always another possibility
360,i do not know if i should end my relationship or try and stick through it,hi michigan relationships are so sparkly for a few years and then things start to feel different most of the time this is simply because we have pulled back from all the attachmentforming behaviours we did at the beginning we stop talking a lot because we have less to discoverwe do less for each other and buy fewer giftsspend less time togetherall because we have already formed the love and attachment and we do not need to fill the gas tank as much so just because it feels different does not mean it is gone badhaving said that it seems as though you are missing something in this relationship that you need you do not feel loved enough right now can you tell him have you told him the strength of your relationship is more clear when people know what the expectations are let him know what you need and see if he gets it you have choices to make and there is no wrong choice you certainly have the right to say this is not feeling great anymore or i want to explore other relationships and walk away but often it is worth it to see how good something can be before you bail you are drawn to someone else and this is up to you to decide how this fits with your expectations of yourself in a relationship your interest in this other guy is sparkly and new your boyfriend cannot compete with that if he does not know you are unhappy for some people being drawn to someone else is a sign they are not into their partner for others it is a danger alert and it makes them want to improve their current relationship which one are you
361,i do not know if my exboyfriend is using opiates again,studies have proven that addiction affects the brain there are many coping skills that addicts use to enable their addiction as well  i would recommend that you speak with someone abut your relationship and your concerns  not only so you can have more clarity in the situation but we often tend to gravitate around or toward the same types of individuals  being more aware of your relationship will help you in the future when reengaging in personal relationships
362,i do not know what to do about my songs lying,a lot depends on the age of your child but given that it was a misused debit card i am going to guess he is a teen  assuming that there are a couple of important things to keep in mind1  that he lied about the misuse indicates he knows he was in the wrong  that is a dreadful feeling  getting caught out and an impulsive lie may have popped out of his mouth before he thought it through   2 once he lied he stuck with the lie    somewhere along the line even though he knew that you knew he was not telling the truth he stuck with his story  and as you said it is not the first time he lied  now it looks like a habit has formedgoing forward when there is a dishonest act of any kind it is essential that you set it up so your son can be truthful  simply put do not ask questions  if you know for certain that he has for example misused your debit card say so  asking did you invites him to get creative with denial asking why did you implies that with a good enough reason he might not be in hot water with you  instead say what is  i see this charge on my debit card and realize you used it without my permission    if he meets with denial stay calm restate that you are aware this happened  then deliver consequences that match the transgression   make it harder to find your card because he is not that great at curbing the impulse to use it yetand most importantly once the consequence is delivered you have to let it go  continuing to bring it up will not benefit him but it does have the potential to make him more sneaky  every time he asks respectfully to use it whether you allow him to or not be sure to praise him for asking nicely  catch him doing it right as often as possiblehang in there  this is not super unusual behavior but it is not acceptable so address it but do not let yourself get too wound up about it
363,i do not know where the lines should be drawn with my boyfriend's ex,how much of your unhappiness with your boyfriend's way of handling himself regarding his ex have you told himthe topics that upset you are the core of any intimate relationshipthe good news is your own awareness of priorities and expectations from a partnerthere may not be any bad news depending on whether your boyfriend has the interest to adjust what he does regarding the extalking the matters you list may open a lot of emotion and become sidetracked very easilya couples' therapist whose focus is on the couple not either of you as individuals may be useful to you and your boyfriend so that you are able to complete your discussions without getting lost by the emotions raised
364,i do not like going outside anymore,the short answer i could give is that we do not know why it is happening the longer answer could come from deeper exploration as to your fears or anxieties that you experience maybe just thinking of going outside but any sort of exploration about this almost has to begin with an agreement within you  that is it is not something to be ashamed of if we are ashamed of any of our behaviors then we lose the ability to sit with them and see where they are coming from this could be something that can be worked through in therapy and specifically with a therapist who specializes in anxiety and more specifically agoraphobia
365,i do not trust my boyfriend,i am sorry for so much stress in your relationship lifein what ways does your boyfriend express his commitment and positive feelings about you to youfrom what you write you feel more aggravation stress loneliness and insecurity than satisfaction by being in this relationshipdoes he care that you do not trust himvery often people stay in relationships from fear of knowing who they really are  the feeling is of needing a partner in a way that is similar to how a fearful child needs staying nearby a parentmy suggestion is to think over how much your sense of need for a partner may be preventing you from actually seeing the amount of love and investment in your relationship your boyfriend actually hasthese realizations are sometimes painful and frightening to understand especially if you grew up in a family that largely ignored or did not adequately nurture you as a childa therapist for your self may be a good investment of time and cost in giving yourself a safe and trustworthy space to think deeply about your best interest
366,i do not want to keep going back and forth between my parents' houses,sounds like a lot is going on right now at such a young age i would start with discussing with mom your concerns and ideal situation i am unsure what prevents you from staying there but whoever you are staying with it should be brought to their attention in regards to your anxiety attacks deep breathing is always a benefits i have a link you can use to help to do this online if you are interested in addition finding ways you usually cope with anxiety and what's worked before can help and if it is not exploring new way to calm you down can be beneficial this is something you can speak with your therapist about going forward when they are availablein regards to feeling suicidal i would call suicide prevention hotline if you truly feel the ideation is getting worse they are professional agents who can speak with you about your ideation and help you through the process hope this helps
367,i endured sexual and physical abuse by my brother as child,i will assume that for whatever reason you either do not want to or are not able to seek counseling for this however i highly urge you to do so because longterm childhood abuse does have negative consequences for your life as an adult as it seems you are already aware there are confidential and free crisis hotlines that you can call that deal with sexual abuse somemost also offer free counseling services in local areas that would be a good place to start looking especially if cost of counseling is an issuethe important thing to know is that what happened was not your fault and that you deserve to live a happy life free of the past having anger and trust issues after something like this is a perfectly normal reaction to what happened to you angry yes at your brother for what he did at your parents for not protecting you having trouble trusting of course the very people who were supposed to love and protect you hurt you instead two books that might help you are codependent no more and boundaries where you end and i begin
368,i feel burned out,does it help to put a name to the experience you are having where you first said i have been upset for no reason and feeling anxious you then say that you are feeling burnt out which gives a little more context to what may have once felt like no reason perhaps you are feeling burnt out that is a big deal and please try not to take it lightly when we get burnt out i have found that it is from one of two things either we are not doing what we want or we are doing too much if either of those rings true for your experience try as much as possible to sit with the experience and get a better sense of where the burn out is coming from i wrote about burnout for a newsletter and it is on my website i do not want to do shameless promotion but i thought it could also add to helping you httpsdavidkleintherapycommyexperienceswithburnouti hope that you can also see that it is not an abnormal experience
369,i feel completely alone in my marriage,your question highlights your pain very clearly  what you are describing is one of the most common scenarios i see in my practice with couples one partner feels terribly lonely and unimportant in response to the other partner either turning towards other people and activities or being withdrawn and turning inward my mind immediately goes to a question for you what happens when you are feeling alone and uncared for what do you say to yourself about you about your spouse and about your relationship  what do you do in response to these feelings do you ask for what you need  does this lead to arguments  do you stay silent or withdrawvery often couples enter into negative patterns where one partner feels afraid of rejection by the other partner and so withdraws from the relationship  and the other partner feels afraid of abandonment by the withdrawing partner and so pursues the other   regardless of who started it these patterns can turn into infinity loops that take on a gravity of their own and ultimately cause both partners to withdraw and dissolve the relationship  if both partners want to work on saving and improving the relationship the way out of this is to learn about your emotions and patterns together so that you can slow down the pattern and stay in touch with the emotions that pull people together  as the patterns slow down partners are better able to get more deeply in touch with their vulnerabilities needs and longings and ask for them to be met in such a way that does not leave the other partner feeling criticized threatened abandoned or uncared forsome couples can do this without the help of a therapist  the book hold me tight 7 conversations for a lifetime of love by sue johnson is a selfhelp book based on emotionally focused therapy  and has been helpful to many couples that i see  when a therapist is needed to help partners reconnect or overcome betrayals i recommend seeking couples therapists who are trained in a scientifically tested model of couples therapy to summarizeyour pain is understandable and valid  it is telling you what you are missing and what you wantreconnection comes when we can listen to what our feelings are telling us express those feelings in a safe way and assert our wantsneeds while remaining open to the vulnerabilities and needs of our partnerif you can do that on your own and your relationship is responsive that is fantastic  if you encounter challenges in resolving this yourself consider therapy with a trained couples therapist using a model that is scientifically validated  pain means this is important  you and your marriage are worth the effort
370,i feel guilty about my fathers death,i see such a sharp contrast between your question and your first sentence do you see it i feel guilty about my father's death and i spent my whole life taking care of my dad wow after everyone else had left him to his misery you hung in there he is so lucky to have had you there you did not have to do that i have a hunch that your dad blamed you for a lot of things abusive people do that a lot they make you believe things are your fault when they are not you did the opposite of what you fear you did you did not contribute to your dad's death your selfless care gave him a longer lifebetter health in the end no one's love and care could save him no one could fault you for deciding you had had enough at some point i would never expect anyone to keep putting themselves in a hurting place over and over again but this is what you did you did it for him and you did it so you would not feel guilty but you feel guilty anyway rightso putting yourself in that position was only worth it if you allow your loving acts to melt away the guilt can you tell yourself it is okay that i had to take care of myself too i gave up a lot for my dad i have nothing to feel guilty aboutputting yourself last for your dad was a loving thing to do and my hope is that you can also find different ways to help yourself feel good enough in this world and a balance between caring for others and caring for yourself  
371,i feel guilty because i did not say no to a guy's advances,hi tennessee there is nothing wrong with you there are many good reasons why you did not say no you did not say no because you were caught off guard and unprepared there is no place in life that teaches girls or boys how to manage it when someone crashes a sexual boundary you also live in a culture where girls are encouraged to be cooperative and not upset people and to put the needs of other people first you instinctively want people to like you and people can be very coercive sexually you said it yourself you gave in he wore you downthere's nothing wrong with you it was not your job to say no women are not the gatekeepers of male sexual urges it was his job to get your consent first he pressured you into it a good therapist would help you to dig deep and uncover all these barriers to saying no and more if you said no what might happen then what might that mean about you what are you avoiding feeling unloved unwanted cold what would you have to believe in order to be confident enough to say no that you did not have to do anything you do not want to do that you are special or that sexuality is special would you need a better understanding of what sexual assault is i love that you want to do some work here to strengthen your sexual boundaries and i urge a widespread conversation about what consent it men and women of all ages could use more of this training
372,i feel insecure on edge and drink too much,given the description you have posted here it may be time to find someone to work with  first and foremost look into working with someone who specializes in working with individuals with challenges surrounding drinking this would need to be assessed first since if it has been ongoing it may be making the situation worse and given the time it has been utilized as a coping mechanism there is reason to believe that the structure of your brain may have been effected as has been demonstrated by current neurological research  there are however ways to address this  as for coping mechanisms the person you work with should also look at offering you alternatives such as the skills found within the dialectic behavior therapy model which has several useful tools to help address the underlying anxiety and difficulty managing emotional regulation  mindfulness another component of dbt should also prove to be useful in both becoming aware of your state of mind and emotional state to allow you to make different choices which has been supported by a growing body of evidence  there are also other tools designed to help repair damaged relationships  well worth looking intoseeking help is never easy and it is only human to be hesitant given some of the cultural views of working with therapist  this is a difficult place to be in and one that is not easy to move out of but sitting on it is not going to help it go away  think of it this way if you broke your arm would you just wrap it up and hope for the best or seek out a professional to help you set the break and teach you how to mend the wound  the same applies here  think of it as first aid for the mind
373,i feel like i cannot control having inappropriate thoughts,it is completely understandable that you would like to find a way to make these intrusive thoughts go away however your feeling that you cannot control having these thoughts is accurate it is also understandable that you would feel helpless and guilty given that you see how these thoughts are effecting your relationship though i would encourage you to go easy on yourself and remember that you are not choosing to have these thoughts i am sure that if there was a switch to turn them off you would flip itthere is no magic technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away however therapy may still have a lot to offer in working with a competent therapist you may be able to gain insight into where these thoughts are coming from and develop new ways of relating to them so that they do not leave you feeling as helpless and guilty and can be more present with your partner though there is no guarantee that the thoughts will go away this may also be a result of work with a therapist either way you may be able to find a way to deal with the thoughts and show up in your relationship in a way that will be satisfying to you and your partner
374,i feel like i could never be with anyone because no one would want me,as a relationship therapist i work with a lot of people who feel similar feelings to some degree or another and almost always find that the origin of these feelings point back towards childhood how did you caregivers express love towards you how did they express love towards one another these early messages become your template for how you have learned to see yourself and what you expect from others in his book wired for love stan tatkin psyd writes “we learn to love ourselves precisely because we have experienced being loved by someone we learn to take care of ourselves because somebody has taken care of us our self worth and selfesteem also develop because of other people”  this could be very fruitful to explore in individual therapy with a relationship therapist who really gets it you may have to interview a few to find the right fit that is ok maybe you would even want to read that book i linked above  noticing this pattern is huge it is where transformation begins and now that you have be kind with yourself it begins there too
375,i feel like i failed myself,helloi write to respond to your recent inquiry for possible increase in selfesteem and positive behavioral change regarding motivation for a new job first of all please try to allow yourself some time for grief of the loss of your dear grandmother it appears you were close to her in many ways and she had a great influence in your life the grief process of anger denial despair and acceptance may be a part of what is keeping you feeling stuck in a cycle of not feeling motivated to find work at this time  perhaps your mind is constantly fighting this grief death can be a traumatic experience for some people and is considered a great loss thus the grief process may continue to be a part of your world for a time but hopefully not keep you stuck on a longterm basis  i would try to reach out to a counselor to discuss this grief process at a deeper level to discern whether her death is part of why you feel this way  grief and loss can also have an effect on your selfesteem  can you begin to see how this cycle is what you may be experiencing one positive i see is that you are continuing to look for a new job  take time to give yourself some credit for the  time you are spending looking for work  also i would recommend you set some shortterm goals first for example make a list of 510 potential new employers and send them each your resume then followup the next week with an email or phone call to make sure the hiring manager or human resources received your resume and have any questions  it is also a good idea to ask for informational interviews in order to get your foot in the door so to speaki hope that this information is helpful to you  please let me know if you have any questions or concernswarmlydenise
376,i feel like i am going to get fired because i cried at work,getting your first job is an exciting terrifying and challenging experience it is something you will remember for a long time and it shapes how you begin to think about yourself as a worker you are literally learning as you go in this completely new environment you are going to make mistakes you are not going to get it right the first time it can be even more challenging if you are having a difficult time building relationships that are supportive at work a couple of things to remember here 1 you are there to do a job and you are getting paid to do it 2 there is a reason or reasons for you wanting to be there and do that work 3 you know best what you need in order to be successful these three items can be helpful to remember especially when we feel our emotions are taking over in a place where we do not feel safe to express them fully if you feel like your supervisor is approachable meaning someone you could talk to because they express confidence in you let them know you are nervous about doing a good job also let them know how you learn new tasks information or expectations so they can deliver the message in a way that you understand becoming a successful worker does not happen overnight but each day you can identify what works for you and what does not by communicating with your work team the easier it will be for you we all had a first job once and were all worried about doing well hang in there and call a counselor if you need more help
377,i feel like i am on my own,understandably you would like support from those who know and love youfrom what you write your family members do not offer you your very reasonable expectationstart by telling particular family members with whom you feel you would have the most likely chance of success in their meeting your expectation by loving youthis way you are able to tell yourself you have tried what is reasonable to trydo not give up on expecting loving support for yourselfif your family members are unwilling to give you this then start to give yourself loving attention and caregradually you will bring yourself in contact with new others who will love youloving yourself makes you attractive so others will find your willingness to be loved
378,i feel like i am putting my full effort in my studies but no one thinks that i am,first of all i am glad that you posted here and i am glad that you recognize the importance of schoolingwhere does your family get the idea that you are not putting in the effort while people can interpret effort differently with talking about schoolwork i would think that your grades would show the effort that you are putting inif you are getting good grades and you are saying that your family does not think your grades are good enough maybe there could be a conversation where you are able to ask them what they are expecting from you and then you could explain what you are doing to prepare maybe you could set time limits so you each have five minutes to discuss this if your grades are not as good as you would like and you are putting in the effort i would still consider having a conversation like i mentioned above and perhaps taking advantage of tutoring or other possibilities offered by your schooljust as a bit more information for you i have been working with children teenagers and adults for more than nine years now when someone tells me that they wish their child would do better in school i always ask what that means sometimes it means that their grades are d's and f's for other families it means that the grades dropped below 95% and in that family that is unacceptable perception makes a big difference hereif you are doing your best and accomplishing your goals that is worth celebrating
379,i feel like i am this dumb fat girl that no one likes and everything is my fault are these normal teenage girl feelings,there are some struggles that are less obvious than others an eating disorder being one of them from just your personal experience alone you might realize how easy it may seem to keep such a secret from those around you in the same way there are many people who struggle secretly with this problem and not many people know or even notice so you are definitely not alone low selfesteem or lack of confidence in some areas are issues that every teen in fact every person has experienced at some point these feelings are normal it sounds though as if these feelings of insecurity and inadequacy have begun to consume your every day thoughts and behaviors bringing you to where you are today  comparing yourself to others purging and feeling extreme guilt sometimes it is best if we seek outside help instead of trying to tackle problems on our own breaking habits that come along with an eating disorder really requires the help of a doctor nutritionist and a therapist who can help change your perspective from the inside out hope this helps
380,i feel like my existence is meaningless,it sounds like you have been struggling with this for quite some time using many of the same coping techniques that feel tried and true to no avail often we fall back on coping techniques that would be helpful in other problems for our depression but the truth is that depression requires it is own little tool kit depression is allencompassing and based on what you have written the symptoms are already affecting work and your personal life in myriad ways  the best route forward would be to seek out counselling admittedly but if your insurance deductible is too high that can be very expensive i would recommend contacting your employee assistance program if offered by your employer if not you can look into community centres for counselling options check if your doctor will give you a referral or your local religious organization if however you are motivated to get your depression under control there are some great workbooks out there that you can use on your own or with your therapist  such as mind over mood
381,i feel like my fiance still in love with his ex,maybe your finance's hair preference for you reflects he still is in love w the exthere are other many reasonable options toomaybe he does not know a lot about hair styles or did not want to even think through the question carefully and also did not want to tell you this directlyhe may have tried to take the easy way out of involving himself in your questionthe key whether or not he loves you is how you feel most of the time in your relationship   if most of the time you trust the sense you are loved and you love him then this gives you some reassurance about how the both of you feel toward each otherit is possible too that your finance has some remaining feelings for the ex   whether or not this makes any difference to you depends on how stable and reliable you feel is the love between the two of you
382,i feel like my friends are ganging up on me,conflict is a tricky beast and shows up in every one of our relationships what i am reading is that you find yourself in a loop of  seeking validation of your thoughts and feelings from your friends rather than validating yourself am i right if you are not validating yourself no one else will be able to either  try finding a small nugget of truth in the feedback your friends give you this will help to lower your defenses and help your friends hear what you are really sharing  and then if you are still feeling vulnerable share that too
383,i feel like my life is pointless,it sounds like you are feeling pretty stuck lonely and hopeless like you have a desire to be more connected to people and to find purpose in life but are not sure what to do i am glad to hear that you have at least one friend and i think it is great that you are reaching out for more connection if you can working with a therapist who is competent in treating depression may be a huge benefit to you and help you to regain a sense of meaning motivation and connection additionally anything you can do to give yourself a little break from the feeling of pointlessness and any ruminating thoughts you may be having may be of help i know it may sound pointless in the moment and you may feel a great deal of inertia in doing so but you may find that if you force yourself to do something small that is pleasurable like taking a walk for example there's a good chance you will be glad that you did so after the fact thank you for reaching out
384,i feel like my mother does not support me,your situation sounds extremely frustratingyou are doing the right move to state you do not want to discuss your depression with heri guess you could ask if she would like to know your reason to not speak w her about your depression  if you feel she can handle a reasonable conversation and you would like to tell her your true reason then schedule this or bring up the topic at a neutral time not in the middle of an argumenthaving an unsupportive mom is difficult enough to accept  you may feel greater success and peach of mind to meditate on accepting her lack of understanding than to engage in arguing when she starts this
385,i feel like my relationship is falling apart,it is ultimately your decision whether or not you go to see your mother i am not sure whether talking with her on the phone or through some videoconferencing application would be something you could do in the meantime until you sort out what you want to dosome things i wonder arewhat makes the two of them not get alongwhat makes him feel threatened or on edge if you visit your mother without him what does he think will happenwhat is he getting out of trying to choose for youwhat is he so afraid ofif you decide to talk about these things with your boyfriend try to do the followingconsider using questions that start with the words who what where when and not why the word why can be really difficult for some people to answer because the word itself triggers an emotional reactiontry to ask him if the two of you can discuss this in a way that you can just ask more questions about what he is experiencing if you can listen without being defensive about what you think and feel you may understand more about where you boyfriend is coming fromremember that understanding what he means does not mean that you have to agree with what he is sayingmaybe he would be willing to listen to what you are experiencing and ask questions about that as you did for him it would be good to do this in a way similar to what an investigative reporter would do and asking questions that cannot be answered in a yes or no format and require more informationi am sure this is putting you in a very tough place if you would like to talk to someone more directly about the details consider seeing a local mental health professional
386,i feel like there is a wedge between my daughter and i,hi new york i am happy to hear that your daughter does not know about her dad's addictions although you do not say how old she is and i imagine that at some point in her life she will be ready to know the truth i trust your instinct that now is not the time your ability to have clear boundaries about what is adult conversation and what is suitable for a child to know are really important here and i can tell you are being appropriately protective and a thoughtful parent as much as this helps your daughter i sense that you also know you cannot take away the emotional pain that comes from having an absent parent children tend to blame themselves for a parent's absence these children need extra love and support wherever they can get ityou say that you feel like there is a wedge between you and your daughter i understand that having your ex partner's relatives in the same home would make it uncomfortable at times it is very important to establish boundaries only you should parent your daughter but it is also natural for people to want to assist you let's trust that their intentions are good if there is no evidence to the contrary as much as they support you they also  have emotional ties to your daughter's father while there is potential for discomfort in this complex situation there are also many positive factors here that i invite you to seei do not know what your culture is but for your daughter to have the opportunity to preserve her father's heritage language and a relationship with his family are potentially wonderful additions to her life in general the more adults around loving and supporting a child the better it could be that you are feeling threatened by small moments where there appears to be a special connection between your daughter and her father's family nothing anyone else does can take your daughter's love from you my hope for you is that you can feel so secure in your own position as loving mother that you will not feel intimidated by other positive connections your daughter has they are potentially wonderful connections and she deserves your support in maintaining those relationships if they do not harm heri suggest that the most important alliances to work on here are between you and your ex's family if you could all give your daughter the gift of a healthy united supportive and loving safety net for herthat is the best outcome of all
387,i feel really down all the time,are you a teen  this is a really hard problem for more teens than let on  when i was about 15 i remember asking my parent's friend herman whether life gets any easier when you get older  he said the problems are actually harder but you gain the ability to deal with them better  i have been an adult a long time now and that is so true if you need someone to talk to consider a teacher or a school guidance counselor or someone you respect maybe in church  if they are good and they do not know how to help you they may know how to get you to someone who can  also the idea of not being good enough is a common psychological event  in cbt it is called a core belief but i call it a core lie in my book living yes a handbook for being human  if you are serious about changing yourself read about it  at wwwlivingyesorg and pick up a copy there or on amazon  i hope this was helpful  the future is filled with possibility if we do not prejudge it  mark 
388,i feel really uncomfortable around other people,since you are aware of your sensitivity to being among large groups of people then continue to satisfy this and stay away from crowds as much as reasonably possibleit is also fine to prefer the companionship of animals as long as it is not to the exclusion of relationships with peoplerecognizing this feature about yourself is another example of selfunderstandingthe only point to consider is the reason you avoid talking with other peopleif its because of bad or stressful encounters betrayals or some type of violation then having this relationship pattern remain in your mind may introduce new problems such as loneliness from lack of close friendswhat you should do is honestly understand whether you avoid people from fear of being hurt or exploited in some way or because you genuinely prefer solitudeif you have the right combination of peoplesolitudeanimals then greatif not then consider the confidential office of a therapist for new understanding of yourself and your social interests
389,i feel stuck in life what can i do,financial stability is probably a good place to start your new life projectif your partner does not work or does not contribute his money to the household bills then maybe you are eligible  for some type of stipend from the governmentespecially since you have kids the child welfare service may intervene to help you  sometimes too a partner who is unwilling to pay for their kids' wellbeing may be pressured by child welfare to make regular contributions to you and your kidsi''m glad you are thinking of your needs and those of your kids  this is the philosophy which will show you what road to follow so all three of you are in a secure financial place
390,i found drugs in my moms drawer—what should i do,i would suggest having a conversation with your dad and then having a conversation as a family with your stepmom  usually there are other signs of use that can often be missed  be aware of behavior changes and mood swings  be supportive and ready to listen often times individuals suffering from addiction will deny use until they are ready for help
391,i found my boyfriend talking to his exgirlfriend,your sense of hurt is very understandabledo you and your boyfriend have an agreement on looking through each other's phonesi ask because the overall problem sounds like lack of trust and that there may be a difference in what each of you wants and expects from your relationshipprobably if the two of you talk about these topics and you each become clear as to the commitment status of each of you to the other you will have more clarity as to what either of you would like from the otherwith this new level of clarity his  past relationship involvements will likely be less meaningful once you have clear definition of the two of you as a couple who he was as a past partner to someone else will matter very little
392,i get depressed whenever anyone i care about is too busy to be with me what do i do,frequently when working with clients i utilize the abc model developed by albert ellis the founder of rational emotive behavior theory the theory basically states that you can not control an event but you can control your reaction to the emotions associated with said event for instance here is an examplea  you need to talk to someone and that person is not calling you backb  you begin to tell yourself that this person is too busy for me or i am not important to this personc  you feel depressedif you look at the model b has a direct effect on c the thought is if you change your reaction to a then c will have a better consequence such asa stays the sameb  this person must be busy they will call me back when they get a chance or i can call someone else to lean on for support until this person is availablec decreased feelings of depression & overall functioning improvesthis is just an example but if you actively work to replace the negative thought patterns that effect your behavior studies show that your overall outlook and mood will improve if this model resonates with you i recommend feeling better getting better staying better by alber ellis in addition looking for support groups in your area are a great source of support when you are feeling abandoned or alone
393,i get so angry that i want to explode,hi campbell river you say you have anger but you do not mention how it shows or maybe it does not are you aggressive with your girlfriend since you mention depression i wonder if you are bottling it all up somewhere instead of letting it show at all if this is the case i admire your ability to not lash out at someone who's hurting you however if they are totally  unexpressed anger turn inward and shift into depression when she yells at you what do you do is this the moment that you feel the most angry i would not be surprised anger is a normal response to someone yelling at you something about angerit is often there to cover up our more vulnerable emotions under the anger i wonder if you feel worthless powerless scared unloved part of the trick to reducing anger is identifying those other emotions and expressing them you say you do not know how to deal with life and i think maybe you mean you do not know how to deal with emotions lots of people do not this is confusing for most of us what am i feeling why is it so strong i am afraid to express it for fear of hurting someone  how do i know what to express and what to be quiet about these are all great questions to ask yourself and a qualified therapist can help you sort it all out and support you in your growth i wish you well
394,i get verbally abused everyday by my parents in front of my child and i cannot take it anymore,hello i am sorry to hear about you feeling verbally abused trapped without an escape and emotionally drained sounds to me like you are being treated more like a child than an adult  it is time to learn about healthy boundaries and being treated like an adult this process will take time but beyond elevating your selfesteem and worth you will be modeling to your children a healthy adult model to them an empowered confident and person that is worthy of respect please invest in yourself find yourself a therapist that encourages and empowers you to have a voice and not feel invisible you will be so glad you did
395,i had a baby about 2 months ago and i really have not been feeling myself,probably  i always tell the new parents i work with that if you are feeling off seek help  postpartum support international is a great place to start finding resources and locating support
396,i had an affair almost two decades ago recently found out it resulted in a child,if your wife is willing seek out a qualified couples therapist look for one trained in the gottman method or emotionally focused therapy your relationship is repairable but you may need some qualified support in the process
397,i hate talking to people much less strangers,did you take the medication the way the psychiatrist prescribed it  did you follow up with herhim to report how it was going  different medications work differently with different people   it is not always the first one that helps  and some of the medications take some time to have an effect  give the doctor the chance to help you i suggest you find a certified cbt therapist to help you examine your thinking  wwwacademyofctorg has listings of the finest cbt clinicians  in the meantime do some anxiety fasting by taking a few minutes to do something nice for yourself right now  i hope you feel better soon  mark 
398,i hate the way i look,this is so very common in this crazy looksobsessed world i meet so many beautiful people who cannot see their beauty is there something getting in the way for you was there a time in your life when people teased you or told you something hurtful or did something to you that made you feel ugly if so this can be addressed first sometimes stories are told about us when we are young and the best thing we can do is see the author's evil or careless intent and not take that on a therapist can help you with this partonce you have addressed any past barriers to feeling confident you can focus on a few simple things first your thoughts if you keep telling yourself that you do not like what you see then you will never feel okay about your looks experiment with telling yourself something different look in the mirror and i dare you to find something that is lovely about your face focus on that describe what you see if you were your own best friend what would you say about your face eliminating those negative scripts and building new positive ones will help you feel more accepting of how you look you cannot change your face but you can change your attitude towards your face confidence is the things that will make you beautifulaccepting how you look is important without going to plastic surgery  you were born with that nose those eyes those lips accepting yourself and knowing it will not change is a good idea because wishing it were different will not make it solooking good is also about minimizing flaws and building on your assets are you in a rut about hairstyle or makeup ask a good friend to give you a makeover play with your features and wardrobe there are plenty of average looking people who know how to make themselves shine because they are creative
399,i have a compulsion to fill in holes in my skin with ink,hi houston the fact that you are concerned says a lot if i was your therapist i would ask you questions about your worries and how this is causing a problem in your life you are causing perhaps permanent changes to your body and it is likely you are trying to express somethingpain maybe a therapist can help you to explore what's going on for you and how to get your needs for selfexpression met in a more healthy way good luck
400,i have a crush on my bestfriend's brother,do you and the brother to whom you feel attracted ever see each other or are in surroundings in which the sisteryour friend is notif yes then this gives you the chance to find out whether you and the brother actually do like each otherif no then definitely have a private and direct conversation with your friend about the fact you are attracted to the brotherfind out the reason your friend becomes angry to hear you like the brotheranything is possible from she would like to warn you about qualities in her brother which you may not know and if you did would not like or react negativelyor if protection is not your friend's reason then maybe she is fearful to lose your friendship if you start a relationship with the brotherfriends are people who care about each others' lives  let your friendship with this girl work on behalf of each of you
401,i have a son with my girlfriend but she is emotionally abusive what do i do,it sounds like you are in a tough situation you have to ask yourself why you do not want to leave her is it because of the child or is it because you want the relationship to work you must consider that being in an abusive relationship is not healthy for you or your child so if the abuse continues it would be more beneficial for you and your child to move outon the other hand if you are just wanting the relationship to work out despite its current state you need to evaluate whether the relationship is worth salvaging it seems as though you are very unhappy and undervalued in this relationship although your question revealed just a short bit of information i did not read about any positives in the relationship sometimes it is extremely hard to leave a relationship even though you know that the relationship itself is harmful for you however with time and focus you can do it each day will get a little easier and you have to trust yourself that you are making the right situation for you and your childhowever if you really feel that you want to stay in the relationship you have to be upfront with her you need to tell her exactly how you feel and give her specific examples of how she is hurting you this gives her a chance to render the situation if after this there is no improvement i suggest that you start reconsidering your decision to stayi also think it would be valuable for you to start engaging in things outside of the home that make you happy are there any hobbies you enjoy are there any groups in the area that you can join such as playgroups that will allow you to engage with other parents start looking into these options and finding an avenue for you to do something for your own benefitit is certainly not healthy for you to isolate yourself from friends and family you need to have additional support networks besides the one with your girlfriend especially since this has not been a healthy environment latelythank you for reaching out i wish you the best of luck with your relationship
402,i have an old roommate who might be a psychopath,you may intuitively be sensing what many professionals in the social sciences and psychology have already understoodjust google psychopaths and leadership and many articles come up about boardroom politics and that psychopaths are very successful in these rolestheoretically is it terrible that corporate leadership qualities match those of psychopaths  well yes  and i consider your question as a mark of your sensitive awareness toward other people  being able to recognize social dynamics is a strength that you havepsychopaths know how to be charming and to twist words so that others believe that their own interest is the same as the psychopath'si agree with you about not being able to change people's minds who are attached to this persongs interactionsthe only way you can introduce a change in the relationship system of a psychopath is that if you are aware of illegal or law breaking activity and you have evidence of this that you contact relevant authoritiesno one is allowed to break laws including psychopaths
403,i have anger issues i am extremely explosive about the simplest things,i suggest that you work on emotional awareness emotional awareness basically means knowing what you are feeling and whyemotional awareness also means that you can identify the link between the way you are feeling and your actions in other words knowing that your feelings dictate what you dooften feelings of hurt or insecurity can come out as anger if we cannot properly identify and express the feelingsbeing emotionally aware also means that you are able to express your feelings to others being unable to do so leads to feelings of frustration and being misunderstoodmany people for many different reasons are not in touch with their emotions for example men traditionally have been brought up taught to not express sadness or weakness therefore many men learned to turn feelings of sadness insecurities or fears into anger and express these feelings as anger being taught not to feel a certain emotion does not make that emotion disappear instead it makes us learn how to express it in other incorrect ways if a man never learns to say “i am sad” or “that really hurt my feelings” and instead lashes out in anger then the response they get from those around them will be to the anger and not a response to the underlying true feeling which will leave the man feeling alone and misunderstoodyou can control yourself and not explode walk away remove yourself from the situation do whatever you have to do to not lash out instead of reacting the way you normally would go somewhere by yourself and think about what just happened and try to understand why such a “simple” thing upset you what is the real feeling driving these outbursts maybe you can begin to recognize an underlying pattern it might help to keep an anger journal write down everything that gets you upset that might help you see a pattern and pinpoint what may be setting you off talking with a therapist about this would be beneficial in helping pinpoint the underlying cause of the outbursts you are experience
404,i have been in a relationship for a year and 7 months these few weeks have been bad,i am willing to bet that this is not what you are hoping to hear but i would suggest giving him space ooph that is a tough one right i know but here's the thing when you keep trying to process and talk it out with him you keep pushing him away he needs to feel like a solid and whole person to be able to be fully in your relationship it is the work of being in relationship to learn this i get that this is tough stuff i wonder outside of being with him how do you soothe and calm yourself that is the stuff for you to tune into and focus on right now
405,i have come to the realization that my boyfriend and i want different things,sounds like your panic is less about loosing the relationship you are in and more about being alone being with him is serving you even if the relationship is less than ideal from being alone being alone can be scary you would have to face yourself you would have to learn to love and care for and cherish yourself all important skills and tasks in maturing and growing up but scary none the less what ifwhat if you gave yourself permission to be in a relationship with you
406,i have difficulty with communication,wow congratulations on being in a masters program you are in a unique place so few have reached that level you should give yourself a pat on the backconfidence is not something that comes naturally but can and does come with practicehaving gone through two masters programs i can sympathize with your your dilemma so how is the stress affecting youis it serious enough to stop you from presenting or is it just butterfliesthere are many ways of dealing with the anxiety and stress much depends on how serious the stress isso here are a few ideas1 practice in front of a mirrorsounds strange but the practice helps2 ask some friends to listen to your presentations not so much for their input as to just get used to presenting3 focus on the material you are presenting the subject matter is what you want to get across step away from your nerves and get into the facts you want to present let the material you present be the focus 4 remember everyone else is just as nervous as you share your fears with some of your classmates and gain support from them focus on a friendly face during the presentation be a support to them in return5 fake it till you make it yes it sounds blunt but sometimes that is what it takes even if you feel like it you will not dieso much more can be discussed with a competent counselor take the time to let a professional help you work through thisagain you have come a long way to be in a graduate program congratulations you have done great work so far it is just one step at a time take the steps
407,i have feelings for one of my best friends,given that both you and your friend recently ended your respective romantic relationships kissing each other sounds like each of you satisfied a very natural need which for right now does not has a natural source of satisfactionsuddenly being without a partner is difficult because a relationship absorbs and offers much of a persongs energy stay focused on what you know about yourself which is that you are not ready for another relationshipfrom what you describe about your friend similar to you he does not feel ready for a new relationshipif and when you feel ready to enter a new relationship and your friend seems attractive then you will be in a position to find out either by approaching your friend as a potential partner or by asking your question of his interest in youwho knowsit is possible your friend will feel ready for a new relationship approach you and depending on your personal wishes to be or not be with who he has become accept his offergood luck with step one becoming familiar with your new state of single hood and sorting through the good news and bad news of your most recent relationship
408,i have long spurts of depression anxiety and need change constantly—why,hello and thank you for your question i am very sorry that you are struggling i have a few thoughts and perhaps some of my colleagues will add something else depression and anxiety can both be chronic conditions as you have experienced this means that they may always require treatment in order to have some kind of relief from them treatment could mean medication or some kind of counseling some people may take medication for the rest of their lives some people may go to counseling at times when the depression and anxiety worsens as you mentioned sometimes the symptoms improve for a little while but they can also come back when they do it is important to talk to your medical provider if you are getting medication andor to go back to your counselor and talk to them about the symptoms that have returned skin picking and some other behaviors are not uncommon for people who are experiencing something like anxiety many people report that they do this when they feel anxious and some say it calms them down it is not really a surprise that you are constantly trying to change things and even starting fights to do so these are ways to try to avoid escape and distract yourself from the feelings of anxiety and depression that is a very normal thing to do nobody likes these feelings and so distraction is something we naturally try in order to get rid of them the problem is that things like distraction and escape do not work as a longterm solution in fact they usually make things worse for many different reasons depression and anxiety can  be treated but it is likely something you will need some help with i would recommend finding a counselor who has experience with anxiety and depression medication can be helpful but i still recommend counseling the reason for this is that the medication can help with symptoms while the counseling can address the symptoms and provide you with very helpful skills be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc
409,i have nightmares and flashbacks about a past relationship,ending an abusive relationship is often very difficult especially if you were very close initially without the presence of abuse  if the abuse included verbal or psychological condemnation you will often have a negative selfimage that you may know is not true but often feels very true this negative selfimage and fear of being abused again can activate protections in you that were needed at the time you were abused but now create a wall in your current relationship  the fact that you were able to end the relationship and know that you made the right decision is a great acknowledgement that you have solid internal resources to draw upon in healing from the abuse  good for younightmares and flashbacks are a strong sign of memories including associated beliefs emotions and physical sensations that have remained unprocessed and therefore unhealed  there are likely reminders  of the past abuse that are being activated in your current relationship that are allowing these unhealed memories to come to the surface and affect both your sleep and your waking experiences  this is certainly not something you are purposefully doing but is the result of what happened to you  however you likely feel as if you are not in control    the goal is protect your current relationship evaluate your selfimage for flaws in beliefs and feelings and begin working on healing your memories of abuse in many cases my use of emdr would be helpful in reducing the emotional strength of your abuse memories reduce or eliminate triggers bring healing and allow you to enjoy being in the present with your current relationship  i would recommend discussing with your current partner your harmful past experiences your decision to pursue counseling and your strong desire to be healthy for your current relationship  with a good support network in place healing is very possible
410,i have the perfect guy but i am not attracted to him,attraction is important but sometimes overrated i am curious about your comment that you are not as attracted as you should be  what is your measuring stick is for what you are supposed to feel in terms of attraction in a relationship do you want to be sexually intimate do you enjoy having sex with him are you satisfied with your sexual relationship when you are with him the fact that there is lust for other more attractive men does not necessarily mean anything there will always be attractive men and more attractive men than your partner and these attractive men will be even more appealing when you are in a longdistance relationship far from the arms of your partner loving someone does not mean that you stop being a sexual being who no longer notices and desires attractive men attraction results from a number of factors beyond appearance  including the degree to which you feel emotionally open safe and connected and how in tune you are with each other's bodies it sounds like you think very highly of this man everything else is perfect about him maybe it is worth spending some more time together in the same place if that is possible before deciding on marriage or that you are not truly in love
411,i have voices in my head,since you realize that hearing voices in your head is not usual for you then definitely there is a problematic situation happening within your awareness of who you areif you recently started taking a new drug or increased dosage of one you already were taking and the voices started shortly after then yes it is possible medication created your problemstart by telling whoever gave you the presecription about the problem you are havingcrazy has some flexibility as to whether someone is this way or notcertainly a very positive sign that you are not crazy is that you are selfaware of a problem within yourself and you are responsible toward yourself and making effort to address this problemcrazy people usually do not do responsible behaviors
412,i just feel so alone,we feel alone because we are not comfortable with being our self when you find that nobody is around do you feel alone your never alone once you take the journey to really understand who you are and unconditionally loving all that is you there will never be an alone moment we seek outside of self to fill inside this is the big lie of the planet all you need and have ever needed you supply yourself wwwlifecounselingorlandocom
413,i just found out my boyfriend has been cheating on me,cheating is often a sign that something is amiss in the relationship his fear may be full of information while it is possible to repair relationships after a betrayal it is also challenging to do especially so early in your relationship i cannot tell you if you shouldshould not give this relationship a second chance but i will tell you to tune into your own intuition 
414,i just lost my grandpa,losing someone you love someone who has been there from your very first days is really hard  look for a local hospice support organization in your community  grief groups and counseling are often available through these centers  do not just tough it out and wait for your sadness to fade  your grandfather would not want that for you  take extra good care of yourself and get some support
415,i keep on changing my life when things get tough,there's a quote i love that says wherever you go there you are and the book by the same name by jon kabatzinn may be very helpful for you the thing about changing things up when they get tough is that they often are not the things that need changing the awesome thing about it is that when you work on the internal aspects that may need attention you can learn to find a sense of centeredness that comes with practicing mindfulness and asking yourself who you really are and want to be through this deeper work you can actually be in the midst of chaos and still feel that calm and peace within yourself if you look for support in this journey from a counselor or therapist i would recommend looking for someone offering acceptance and commitment therapy or mindfulnessbased cognitive behavioral therapy  also helpful may be the online program of mindfulness based stress reduction found here there are inperson programs across the country but this online selfguided version is free and a great resource
416,i lie to my mom about my relationship,i understand that this can be difficult when you care about someone have you had a discussion with your mom as to why she does not want you and this boy to see each other and what her concerns are it sounds as though you and your mom may be able to use some help with communicating and compromising it is understandable that you do not to feel comfortable having  to lie to your mom it  would be helpful if she could understand that you having to lie to he is getting in the way of you being able to go to her with any issue and  feel she will hopefully understand or try to understand where you are coming from  have either one of you been in family therapy this may be something you may want to suggest to your mom to help you both understand where each one is coming from if your mood is sad and your feeling worse it is important that you reach out to an adult parent person at school whom you trust to share your feelings and help you feel understood and work through your problems
417,i lied to my mom then felt bad and told her the truth,it sounds like you have already learned that just being honest is often the best approach what do you think about telling your mom how you are feeling  she might really appreciate it if you also let her know that regaining her trust is really important to you
418,i lost my mom and i feel like i am depressed,i am so sorry about your loss  losing someone you love is always difficult however losing a mother is a significant loss in a daughters life  what makes this loss complicated is that it appears you have also had a loss in your relationship with your sister  it is difficult to know what happened with your sister with the limited information you have provided but what i suspect is that there are some unresolved issues between the two of you and that she may be projecting her pain on to you  it is important to remember that your sister is also grieving the loss of your mother and may not be dealing with it in a very healthy way  by her bringing up your relationship with your mother and suggesting that you were never close to her is her opinion  only you can define and determine what your relationship was like with your mother  if there is truth to this then it may be something you may need to talk about with a counselor   there could be an added layer of ambiguous loss in that you are not only grieving her physical absence but could be grieving the loss of a relationship you wish you could have had with her and the realization that you never will  you and your sister are both in the heart of the grieving cycle  when two people are grieving the same loss at the same time it is difficult to provide support to each other because of their own struggle even if they both were on good terms with each other  depression is part of the cycle of grief  it is absolutely normal to feel sad as well as experiencing other depressive symptoms   anger is another phase of the grief cycle  your sister may be stuck in the anger phase not wanting to connect with her own feelings of sadness so this may be why she is being hurtful towards you in projecting her anger onto you in order to avoid the vulnerability of experiencing her own grieffinally it appears that your depression proceeded the loss of your mother and is making your experience with grief more complicated  were you officially diagnosed and treated for depression prior to your loss  depression in grief is different than a depressive mood disorder  depression can be situational or related to genetics undiagnosed health issues stress trauma or other potential risk factors  if you have a family history of depression you are more susceptible to have depression  it would be wise for you to discuss this with a mental health provider and if necessary get treatment through counseling and medical interventions
419,i need help controlling my anger,i need help controlling my angeranger is like a blanket that contains other emotion from bursting out and serves as a shield to protect us when we are not able to manage external issues   anger also helps us understand that there’s something wrong that needs to change  once we understand that something else caused us to feel angry then we can explore the source of anger ask yourself why am angry am i hurt disappointed confused embarrassed etc  once you find the answer explore how often that happens and what’s your reaction  then explore how else you could respond or react  you could use istatements as a way to communicate your true feelings to your girlfriend or whoever is involved in the scenario  this is a good exercise to practice with your counselor or mental health provider because many unresolved issues may arise during this exploration especially if you have been angry for a long timealso it is important to understand the difference between anger and aggression and learn to manage our anger before we act on it  anger is a feeling aggression is when you act out your anger physically verbally and psychologically  find ways to vent crying or sweating will help to release your anger and balance the chemical response that our body creates when you become angry  physical activity and meditation exercises can also provide a break when you manage strong emotionsnecesito ayuda para controlar mi corajeel coraje es como una manta que cubre otras emociones evitando que se desborden y sirve como un escudo que nos protege cuando no podemos manejar problemas externos  el coraje también nos ayudo a entender que hay algo mal que debemos cambiar  cuando entendemos que algo mas causo el coraje entonces podemos explorar la fuentepregúntate a ti mismo ¿por qué tengo coraje estoy herido decepcionado confundido avergonzado etc  ya que encuentres la respuesta explora cuan frecuente tienes esa reacción  luego explora como puedes reaccionar en otra ocasión  puedes usar expresiones del yo para comunicar tus verdaderos sentimientos a la persona envuelta en la situación  esto es un buen ejercicio para practicar con tu consejero o profesional de la salud mental ya que otros conflictos sin resolver pueden surgir durante este proceso de exploracióntambién es importante entender la diferencia entre el coraje y la agresión y aprender a manejar el coraje antes que actuemos  el coraje es un sentimiento y la agresión es cuando expresas tu coraje agrediendo a alguien física emocional o sicológicamente  encuentra maneras de desagotare llorar o sudar te pueden ayudar en este proceso al balancear la respuesta química que crea el cuerpo cuando estamos molestos  el la actividad física y la meditación también pueden ayudarte a relajarte y tomar un descanso cuando manejas emociones fuertes
420,i need help coping with depression as a result of stress,i could not help but notice that you did not specify your age so i am unable to set the total chronological order and length that you have suffered in this way but i want to start by commending you on seeking out additional coping techniques on your own  unfortunately it sounds like you were offered some that were more dangerous than helpful but be proud that you were able to curb those before they caused too much harm from what you have written stress has always been a difficult thing for you to manage  often when i am working with those who offer the same concern there is a degree of people pleasing that comes with that stress  when we are trying to make others happy especially when we are unable to distinguish the proper rules for success it can make even the simplest of tasks overwhelming stress management is just that management of our own anxieties about the needs of others about our skills and the ability to complete a task and having multiple requests at any given time each of these aspects requires a separate sets of tools to manage them accordingly for example assertiveness communication training could aid in communicating with your colleagues to manage their expectations of your deadlines and abilities but it will not assist you with managing your own anxieties try to separate the different areas of the problem in order to help yourself to find a solution and work on them in their own time perhaps keeping a journal will help you to better understand why you are so easily overwhelmed by stress and help you track some of your lesshelpful responses to stress for example does a certain persongs style of communication always make you feel undervalued and therefore push you to finish their requests first is there a certain time of the day where you start to fall off in productivity  is that the time fo the day where you also tend to pile up your requirementstry to ask yourself some of these harder questions and see where they lead you
421,i need help with my severe claustrophobia motorphobia and anxiety,not having support from your family for such a significant problem is a problem itselfhow about your friends are any of them nurturing or treat you kindly when you bring up that you have got this problemare any of your friends willing to accommodate the fact that right now you have got panic attacks from driving and being a passengermaybe being and feeling accepted while you are in this current phase of your life would help diminish the panic attacksif no support is coming to you then a next step would be to evaluate the relationships in your life and to develop standards and expectations of others especially that they are considerate of your great need at this timeits possible you are bearing the emotional burden of a lot more people in your life than yourselfif no one wants to show they care about this situation then release yourself from trying to please and satisfy everyone's wish that you be better while they ignore your need for their supportbe realistic in what you are able to give back to people who want to be blind to your emotional needthinking this way will at first raise your anxiety level from fear of losing everyone  eventually you will stabilize within yourself and know that all you are asking for is some support for having a tough time hopefully the others will be more responsive to youif they do not you still know that you are being reasonable for what you would like
422,i need to know how to cope with misophonia before i go completely insane,probably good to know in what type of situations you are in which you are hearing mouth breathing and snoringif you are sleeping beside your partner who does these actions would have a different response than if you overhear mouth breathing and snoring from a family member who is napping on the couch and you are walking past them on your way to take a snack in the kitchenbasically if the person who does these actions which bother you start by telling themdepending on whether they are empathetic to how distressed you are from their sounds or not willing to change or not has a good deal to do with next stepsi do not really see any step you are able to take to solve that you are sensitive to human sounds from the headone path i do not recommend is expecting yourself to ignore the fact of being feeling bothered or dismissing your own sensitivity someoneyour needs matter
423,i over endulge when i drink alcohol and feel extremely guilty about it the next day,hello i commend you for your courage in taking a look at the role alcohol has in your life it sounds like you are concerned about what happens when you drink too much and i suspect you already know the answer to your question about whether you have a problem or not i imagine you would like to stop feeling guilty and would like to avoid cheating on your boyfriend or other negative consequences and maybe have a fear of being or becoming an addict or alcoholic you might have a problem but that does not necessarily mean that you are an addict i do not have information to know if addiction or dependence or other words would best describe where you are with drinking but it sounds like it is begun to have some negatives so forgive me using words like addict dependence and so on i mean it more as a road map than a diagnosis the feedback i am writing here is very general and does not address physical dependence and many other factors that might apply to your situation  one of the ways to think about substance use is to think of addiction as a disease of avoidance let me repeat that it is a disease of avoidance your ultimate task in living a balanced life is to figure out what you are avoiding and develop other ways to manage those feelings experiences and so on and of course along the way you may want to look at triggers situations biological vulnerability social pressures coping skills relapse prevention planning and so on depending on where you are in your drinking you might very well benefit from expertise and support remember also that alcohol depresses our central nervous system and disinhibits us that means that alcohol is often a substance of choice to relax destress calm down etc also it allows feelings thoughts and behaviors that we usually inhibit to be expressed if you were unfaithful and often angry that is your first signpost for angry drinkers it is often true that you do not drink and then get angry you drink in order to express anger i recommend you find someone you can speak frankly with who is knowledgeable about addiction wishing you the best health and wellness
424,i recently lied to my fiancé about my past,well let's start with the awesome realization you have already had you want to notice that you have triggers that is huge really i find that when people lie it is most often as a defense mechanism which is likely a flag that something does not feel safe what exactly does not feel safe could be lots of different things but the key to notice is that it is that feeling of insecurity that is very likely triggering you it could really help to explore this with therapist perhaps even someone with a trauma specialty  that is not to say this is related to a trauma but more so to suggest that therapists specializing in trauma are very skilled at helping to identify and assist in repatterning your triggers
425,i started dating someone and found out they lied about some things—what should i do,your doubts about your dating partner need to be addressed and solved so you can fully believe him againotherwise how would you actually know whether he is lying to you now or notstart the conversation with him about wanting to trust him and asking for whatever details you feel will give you confidence he is telling you the truthif he really wants to clear your doubts then he will be willing to invest in answering your extra questions or wanting to look through his phone or whatever areas you felt were violated by him in the past
426,i tell my husband i love him but i do not believe it or feel it,sustaining passion in marriage is tough stuff it is a relatively modern dilemma you are facing with perhaps unrealistic expectations of what marriage should be it sounds like your definitions of love and sexual passion have merged together that is both common and confusing intimacy and sexuality within your marriage are bound to ebb and flow resparking your passion will involve growing using your sexual drama and fantasies as windows into discovering your needs and wants  marriage is a people growing process you mature into one another and to achieve fulfillment your continued development will be required
427,i think i can become a transgender but how can i be sure,hello frostproofthinking about becoming transgender and being transgender are slightly different  this is a topic that is best discussed with a therapist that specializes in lgbtq issues  from what you have written it sounds as if you still have some confusion as to where you fit in with the labeling system  while labels provide a means to quickly identify and classify they can also feel restrictive or confining  instead of focusing on fitting into a specific classification explore who you are as a person and celebrate your positive qualities and those things that make you uniquely you  there are many options for you to find a therapist and etherapy is also an option  you can try breakthrough an online service   here is some reading for refection that you may find helpful  yin yang woman man httpdldbzejvk2  what does it mean to be a woman or a man
428,i think i empathize too much,sometimes it is helps to have a name for a problem  it can make you feel less alone as in oh there's a name for this and other people have this experience too on the other hand naming the problem can also make it stick around longer as in now i have a special problem that has a special name and that is an important part of who i ambottom line whether it is a disorder or not you would like life to be easier and not have to be pulled so much by other people's energy and feelings you might want to try imagining that you have a volume dial on your empathy that you can gently turn down to the point where you still feel what's going on but it is not so loud you can also try imagining pulling your own energy back as if you were drawing your energy back home to the center of your own body and being letting go of the other people or characters that pulled your energy out so far this is a way create better boundaries and protect your own vulnerability just like on an airplane where they tell you to put on your own oxygen mask first before helping anyone else your empathy will most likely not really help others if you allow yourself to be depleted
429,i think i have a fetish that might be getting out of control,why not make good use of your unexpected attraction to study the features you consider attractive in someoneattraction based on physicality is normal  as long as you have no negative thoughts of doing harm to the person or yourself which are connected to the attraction you feel and so long as your attraction is not stopping you from doing your daily life responsibilities such as work to take care of your daily needs and any responsibilities you have for other people then eventually it will lose its power on you
430,i think i have anxiety and depression it has manifested an extreme distrust for others,you may be pressuring yourself to be the one person who fixes the relationship  this is impossible because the relationship belongs to both of youhas he told you whether he feels about himself that how he interacts with you is contributing to problems in the coupleis he willing to understand what you are asking of him without shutting down with whatever he is feeling when he feels blamedyour feelings of distrust are the natural outcome of not being properly heard and understood  he is not willing to listen to you so of course you are frustrated and this frustration comes out in all sorts of uneasy feelingswillingness to hear each other in a nondefensive way sometimes requires a couples therapist's assistanceask your husband if he is willing to understand not judge you  be willing yourself to do the sameif after trying and getting nowhere you will know when to stop trying on your own as a couple and to find a specifically trained couples therapistswarning not all therapists are trained to do couples therapy  ask the therapist if they have had specialized training in couples therapyotherwise having a referee type therapy session of what do you think what do you think is not going to do anything except frustrate both of you furthergood luck
431,i think my daughter is stressing too much,watching children go through challenges in their lives is difficult on a very basic level there exists a primal need to protect them from harm the hard part for parents is letting them feel those challenges and working through them as they get older at some point there is a moment that occurs when the role as a parent shifts children no longer need the basics as much as when they were toddlers but rather their needs shift to wanting more support encouragement advice and room to make mistakes this is where the ability to communicate with them letting them direct the sails to gather the wind needed to move is so important keep the lines of communication open and be available to give feedback when they ask for it
432,i think my friend might have depression,sounds like signs of someone who is depressedsince the person in question is your friend offer your friendship to listen to any situations or feelings she has about herself and the way her life is goingdepressed people are often lonely people and feel as though no one around them cares or notices them  your willingness to be available to her may lift her spirits  feeling loved goes a long way to dissolving depressed feelingsalso if in the beginning when you offer to talk there is a high chance she will be defensive and turn down your offertry again on another day and then another daywhen people feel depressed they usually shut down  so you may need a few or several tries before your friend accepts your offer to show her you care about how she is doingalso watch for signs within yourself that your friends' depression is not sinking your emotions  depressed people are draining to be around because they often see and talk about only the negatives and drawbacks of situations
433,i think my trust issues are going to end my relationship early,if you thing your trust issues are going to end or affect your relationship it will because you are being baggage from your parents into this relationship  do not allow their problems to become your problem  you did not mention that your partner in your present relationship have done anything to make you not trust them  like in the court of law if no evidencefind not guilty  do not make them pay the consequences as if guilty of your parents unhealthy behavior
434,i think my wife is running from the pain of losing our first born,i am sorry that you lost your first born child  death of a child always leaves a permanent reminder to the parents of a very painful time in their livesthe good news is your awareness that you and your wife are not connected in a satisfying waythere are many possible areas to examine in your relationship as partners and as parentsif what you write here are your observations and theories about your wife's outlook and conclusions then the first step is to directly have conversations together on the topics you write herewhat needs clarifying is what her reasons are for wanting to leave the marriageoften a crisis such as a child's death motivates someone to look deeply into other intimate relationships  keep in mind that looking deeply does not necessarily mean leaving the marriagealso be aware of your own frustrations and marital discontent  be ready to talk about your feelings and uncertaintiesthere is no such thing as one happy partner in a marriage and one unhappy partner   each person is part of a system and can only be as satisfied as their partnerthe conversations that open relationship hurts and disappointments hold a lot of emotion  they are difficult to keep on trackbest recommendation is to find a couples therapist who will be neutral to each of you as individuals and help both of you examine the true health of the relationship
435,i told my family doctor yesterday that i am hoarding my ativan pills is he legally required to tell my psychiatrist or therapist,your doctor might be required to tell your psychiatrist  especially if your doctor is concerned about your safetyit was definitely a good thing that you told your primary care physician about what is going on  i know that must have been difficult to talk about with him  by having that conversation you are helping your primary care physician and your psychiatrist work together to best support your health
436,i want help with how to deal with my abused daughter,sorry to hear about your high degree of stresshow old is your daughterwho abused yours daughterthe answers make a difference to your decisionobviously if the father was the abuser then unless your ex demonstrates to you and you believe he will not abuse her your daughter should stay with youif someone other than the father was the abuser and the father has a good relationship with your daughter then it is possible that the time away from your household will give each of you time away from arguing with one anotherwhat does your daughter tell you she wantsher wishes must be considered toorelationships can be fixed   sometimes being apart helps this process because the two people each have time to reflect more deeply on what they value about the other
437,i want to be a boy but i cannot because of my religion,chances are your family already knows they are probably just waiting on confirmation from you to say it a parent knows their child
438,i want to become a better man,what an important question and the fact that you are asking it is a big step in the right direction to answer in detail would require having quite a bit more information about what relationship problems have occurred  that woke you up to the fact that you are not listening as well as you could and that you are running the risk of losing hergiven that i do not have all that information i will offer one simple suggestion your girlfriend is the expert on what she needs and wants in relationship you could simply say to her that you know you still have a lot to learn about how to have a good relationship and you realize you are not yet understanding what she needs and you really want to then take a deep breath settle down and listen do not argue do not interrupt do not judge listen let her know what you understand and that you are open to hearing more learning more if you are not quite getting it yet and then listen some more be present and curious about this person you love dearly and do not want to lose this is the first step toward intimacy
439,i want to feel more comfortable around people,there's a lot of layers there to your situation and i am focusing on two layers that may be contributing to your feelings of discomfort around others  one layer is the daunting news that your son has autism  many parents can feel overwhelmed and distraught with this diagnosis  the vast array of treatments available is daunting in and of itself at times to wrap one's head around  taking time to reflect or seek out therapy regarding how this diagnosis has impacted you may be helpful  some parents feel their individual identity gets lost in the diagnosis because they have dropped everything to help their child and others may experience guilt  if either of these or other feelings come to the forefront for you it may be worth working through them with a therapist  a support group list is available through wwwautismspeaksorg and may help connect you with others raising children with autisma second layer is the abusive relationship you were involved in  the trauma you experienced in this relationship may have a very meaningful impact on your ability to trust and to be intimate with others  engaging with a therapist can help facilitate the healing process as well as paving the way for more comfortable and trusting relationships
440,i want to get back with my kid's mother and be a family again,how you you expressed your regret and taken responsibility for the pain thus far repair is a very essential skill in and part of developing healthy relationships your love sounds deep sit with that also sit with how she is been hurt you get to feel your hurt too and your kids in feeling all this you may also find our way to the repair if feeling all this is tough to take on seek out a local therapist to support your process
441,i want to have a threesome with my husband and another girl but i feel really nervous,as someone who specializes in sexuality and polyamory i can tell you that your experience is incredibly common it can be helpful to keep in mind that alcohol lowers our inhibitions and for first time threesomes or any new sexual behavior really we humans tend to enjoy a little extra oomph to our courage levels that being said it also lowers our ability to make well thoughtout decisions this combined with the brain rewarding novelty and maybe even some overzealousness and performance anxiety could likely explain why your husband was on her more than you my encouragement to you is to try not to overthink it at this stage now if you two choose to bring her or someone else into the bedroom again and a similar thing keeps happening i would definitely push the issue and see what's up from his perspectivethe empty feeling could be any number of things includingfear that you are not enough for himfear that she is better than you in some wayfear that if we keep doing this thing he will need it and what happens if i no longer want itopposite fear of what if i now want her more than him or if i want the threesomes and he does notfear of does this mean our sex life is not good enough as it isdo we have to always add a little spice to keep it hotor like robin alluded to preconceived notions about what culture religion family and friends etc say about what marriage and sex should look like  i also agree with her encouragement to explore the empty feeling further and see what nuances of other feelings are in therejealousy insecurity shame regret longing  when you can identify and name them they are easier handled some of the resources i recommend poly sexually open couples are“love in abundance a counselor’s advice on open relationships” by kathy labriola“the jealousy workbook exercises and insights for managing open relationships” by kathy labriola“rewriting the rules an integrative guide to love sex and relationships” by meg barker“more than two a practical guide to ethical polyamory” by franklin veaux & eve rickert“the game changer a memoir of disruptive love” by franklin veaux“the ethical slut a practical guide to polyamory open relationships and other adventures” by dossie easton & janet hardy“opening up a guide to creating and sustaining open relationships” by tristan taormino“open all the way confessions from my open marriage” by sadie smythe“henry and june from ‘a journal of love’ – the unexpurgated diary of anais nin “personally i find your cravings to be healthy and quite normal the key is to make them work well for you and your partner robings also right about communication being key some of the suggested resources above can help get those conversations started and if you need further assistance absolutely i would find a sexpositive polypositive counselor to chat withbest of luck to youtamara powell lmhc
442,i want to have sexual experiences with adults male or female,the thoughts you are having are just thoughts  not actions  it is your choice whether you act on these thoughts  if you decide to explore having sex with adults of different genders that is great  if you find yourself obsessed with sexual thoughts you may want to see a cognitivebehavioural therapist  take care
443,i want to make my own decisions,if the only way the relationship you have with your mother feels okay is when she is the only one who makes decisions concerning your life then this only seems okin fact it is not okay for one person to be the authority for another person unless the one for whom this is being done does not have their own ability to think for themselvesseparating your own wishes and way of handling life matters from your mother's point of view may be difficultfirst realize you need to get familiar with feeling at ease with the idea of deciding matters for yourselfyou will need practice until you feel comfortableunless if you have been thinking through decisions you would like to make and the idea of your mother's anger is the only point which stopped you then you may almost instantly start living in a liberated way of running your own lifebasically it is right and fair for you to have the chance to live your life the way you feel is best   be prepared that your mother may disagree with you and that her disagreement is not a reason itself to not do what you believe is in your best interest
444,i want to stop physically abusing my girlfriend,hi baton rougei am glad you are reaching out the first step here is that you are taking some responsibility for your behaviours i do hear you minimizing your actions  but you are headed in the right direction i hope that in your pursuit of treatment you learn that the harm you are causing is not just superficial bruising the effects of using aggression and anger to control a person are deep and lasting wounds please seek treatment for yourself immediatelyyou say you love your girlfriend do you love her enough to leave the relationship while you address your issues are you brave enough to not lean on this relationship while you learn how to create a safe place for a partneryou have dangerous habits because you do not know how to manage your own emotional pain you can unlearn this and it does not mean you are a bad person sometimes however the relationship in which you have done the hurting is best ended for both of your sakes because too much damage has been donei know you do not want to lose her but you do not own her and you do not have the right to trap her in this because you are afraid of being alone right now she needs some space to figure out what's best for her and the freedom to make whatever decision she wants this is potentially the first step to learning real respect honouring her need for safety above your need for comfort i wish you well
445,i was duped into getting married to a therapist but once her immigration status was secure she bolted,i am sorry to hear about being taken advantage of by your former wifeon the positive side think of how much you learned by going through this very painful timemaybe you are naturally very generous and caring to the point of expecting very little from the other person for exampleconsider yourself in a favorable position to not feel like going out right now and meeting a new person   your spirit is guiding you to stay put and recuperate from this ordeal review for any signs you may have been more trusting than merited by the persongs behaviorthere's a natural flow to what we are able to handle and when we have renewed capacity for new adventuresthere's no reason to assume that you will never trust another woman again  the first step is rebuilding trust in yourself to step into a new relationship   there is no designated time line  you will simply feel more ready than you feel nowvery unlikely that you would ever place yourself in a similar situation to the one you are currently recovering fromgood luck
446,i weigh over 220 pounds and i am 16 years old,hey  i am so impressed with your efforts to ask questions to figure out how to change the messages that you hear  and to get support  and it sounds like you want to make some changes in your life  take a walk over to the counseling office at school the school nurse or consider reaching out to your pediatrician’s office you don’t have to have your parent’s permission to seek support for yourself  and maybe taking control of your support network will give you the strength to make even bigger decisions about your health  i am rooting for you  be wise
447,i am a 19 year old male with low self esteem i have always been very closed off about my feelings and problems,hey  it takes a lot of courage to share your feelings with someone  and it sounds like you have been lucky to meet someone who makes you feel safe enough to explore some of your more painful feelings  a big part of the process however of strengthening your selfconcept is learning how to tell yourself those positive messages that you heard from your friend  leaving for college may also be contributing to your feelings of unsteadiness  try this  make a list of all of the positive things that you know are true about yourself  ask your friends and family to contribute to the list  then carry it with you in your wallet  and when you need a selfesteem boost take a look at it  you are in a season of life that presents lots of challenges and opportunities  reach out to your longdistance friend when you need support  and take a walk over to the campus counseling center and check out what they might have to offer  be wise
448,i am a mess physically mentally emotionally and spiritually,the fact that you are reaching out says that there is something in you that wants this to be different and that drive might be something worth tapping into why do i keep trying is a question that might give you some insight into what it is in you that keeps you going a lot of therapistscounselors are now offering video therapy as long as you are in the same state as a therapist offering this service you could connect with someone helpful from the comfort of your home even being in your small town i would recommend looking into this option because you are asking a lot of really deep questions and might benefit from having those conversations with someone who can help you find your own answers
449,i am a teenager and i want to have a baby with my boyfriend,hi athens when a teenager wants to have a baby it is usually for a specific and not healthy reason do you maybe hope that a baby will cement your relationship it does not work that way do you yearn for a person who will love you deeply babies do not give to us we give endlessly to them i urge you to talk to someone you trust about why you want to speed up your life by being a parent before you are fully grown emotionally a relationship that is one month old is not stable enough to support a change like this you are only starting to get to know each other i wish you well and hope you talk to someone
450,i am addicted to smoking how can i stop,hi good for you in planning ahead to do what's healthiest for your baby  that is a great first step it is also good that you are able to identify that it is not always a physical need that is driving the addictionfor the next steps i would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur the psychological cravings are usually based out of habit such as having a cigarette after a meal and if you are consciously trying to quit you will find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel etc etc well if i am on a diet and i continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer eventually i will give in and eat ityou are going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette that is normal and for the most part out of your control but you choose whether or not to continue thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought that is what you would have to work on changing when you have that initial thought acknowledge it  but then change the thoughts that typically follow distract yourself think about something else do something else whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigarettei have suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what they are going to do when the time comes write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it eventually it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have itbest of luck and you have a really great motivator to quit  your baby
451,i am attracted to my boss,there are many possible ways dating your boss could go awry and jeopardize your occupational wellbeing so my recommendation is to hold off on presenting your boss with a personalized gift and instead focus on building attraction and romantic interest with someone who is not at the workplace  sometimes the element of power and unavailability can heighten our sexual interest but that does not mean it is a healthy idea to pursue someone who is in a position of power over you at your workplace
452,i am concerned about my 12 year old daughter,it is great that you are noticing these changes with your daughter i can’t offer advice without knowing much more about your particular situation but some things to think abouthas something else happen recently that has been stressful upsettingis your daughter trying to communicate something to you and if so what might that behave you discussed these recent changes with her there is so much changing for her nowcommunication and connection are crucial i hope you both can talk to a supportive person about all these changes
453,i am dating a boy that my religious parents do not like and i am having trouble finding my identity,what a tough situation you must be in feeling torn between your parents and someone who is very special to you i would say the first thing you want to do is  have a calm reciprocal conversation with your parents telling them how you feel and letting them know what you need from them if communication attempts are unsucessful then you will need to make a decision with how you would like to move forward you unfortunately will not be able to change your parent's feelings or opinions but you can agree to disagree on certain matters by keeping them separate from the relationship you have with your parents it always helps to try and see things from another angle you might want to for example try and understand your parent's perspectives and let them know you understand that they are upset validating other's feelings can be very helpful with communicating effectively are you living with your parents and do they support you if so are you willing to give that up should you decide to not follow their rules know that there is nothing wrong with being happy with someone or loving somebody so deeply your feelings and actions certainly do not make you brainwashed or a devil worshipper not everyone will always approve of the choices we make and sometimes we need to be okay with that best of luck to you
454,i am depressed and unable to connect with people after my breakup,hi boise i am sorry that you have lost this love the fact that you were planning marriage and a future tells me that you meant something very special to each other at that time it is different nowyou are not together anymore but you cannot accept this right good for you for identifying that this situation is damaging your life you have been grieving for longer than you were together oh but really you have not been grievingyou are stuck still loving her instead of moving forward unrequited love is a recipe for eternal heartache let's look at some possible blocks to moving forwardit could be that there's something unfinished for you maybe you felt hurt and you did not have the chance to say so or you felt you hurt her and you did not have the chance to make it right maybe there's a burning question you need to ask or something else you need to say maybe you want to tell her you have never stopped loving her and see if she feels the same way if this is the case you have two choices right you can reach out and say what you need to say or you can stop ruminating on that question and let it go if you reach out there's no guarantee it will go well or that she will even respond maybe write her a letter and do not send it  use the next paragraph to help you decide do you know how she feels how did it end did she end it was it ended just because of the distance or are there more differences between you that did not work sometimes people are so in love that they cannot clearly see that the other person is not in love with them anymore use the information you have about what she wants for her lifecan you honour what she says she needs if she is asked for distance you would do well to honour thata key to moving forward look at your thoughts and where they are getting stuck write it down what bad thing can happen if you let it go or if i move forward that will mean  keep goingwhat would be the worst part of that  this kind of exploring can help you identify your stuck placeit is possible that you have turned this ending into some kind of negative meaning about you or your future as in if this person does not love me then i am unlovable or no one will ever love me as much as she did so your need to cling to her in your heart is your way of rejecting that negative message about yourself or the future can you find another way to reject that message try saying these things to yourselfi know she loved me there is evidence of thati was a good partner there is evidence of thatit is part of life to fall in love and then have to move forwardi can do this and learn from itmany people like methat is how i know i am lovableit is normal to feel sad i am grieving a lost lovei want to move forward and not stare in the rearview mirrori know more love awaits me if i can get fear out of the wayif this person loved me others can too these are the kinds of things a therapist would explore with you i wish you well
455,i am depressed because my mother kicked me out after having a child,congrats on the birth of your sonwas your mom's request for you to leave her house one which she asked awhile ago or was this her greeting when you walked in the doormy question is whether your mom had some changed circumstance in her life whether she and you discussed living arrangements prior to your songs birth or whether nothing was talked about you assumed you would be living with her she assumed you would not and the two of you did not speak to one another about any of thisdepending on the answers there may be clues as to handling future expectations of others especially your momfrom what you write the womengs home is supportive of your basic daily living needs   it is good news that the people who run this home know and offer community resourcesin your interactions with the staff of the womengs home ask all the questions necessary so you will have a clear understanding of the apartment lease anything at all that is on your mind about becoming employed and finding childcarethe point is to have all the major steps you are about to start addressedthis way you will be minimizing the possibility of any sudden bad news by the womengs home told to yousending lots of good luck
456,i am depressed because my wife is divorcing me and i have not seen my child in a while,it is hard to accept the end of a marriage when it is not your choice you feel powerless abandoned and unwanted your wife has the right to decide not to be in a marriage with you and a therapist can help you accept and move through this change that has broken your heart and left you lost you do not indicate why you have not seen your child and you may want to consult with a lawyer about the laws in your area and how to gain access to your baby therapists do not intervene in these ways the marriage may be ending but your role as a loving father is only beginning  you can focus on giving your child the gift of two parents who respect each other
457,i am desperate for attention and i do not know what to do about it,hi michigan good for you for recognising a destructive pattern this behaviour although it might get you the attention you want initially will ultimately drive men away because it is not respectful of them my gut says that you learned early on in life that your value is in your sexuality alone that is a powerful thought you are certainly acting as if this is true if you believed in your value as a person you would be less afraid of deeper relationships and intimacy in general if i were your therapist i would have many questions for you and i would need to understand a lot of things about you and your past to help you sort out where this idea about yourself came from i would suggest reaching out to a qualified therapist who can help you get to the root of this behaviour good luck
458,i am disgusted by my own fetish,try to understand your own ambivalence to having your wish fulfilledsince you and your wife are in a relationship the sex she will have with another man will affect emotions in both you and your wifei suggest you and her prepare emotionally before you both go ahead with the sexual arrangementby anticipating any jealousy or feeling helpless or out of control or in control since it is your wish being fulfilled all the feelings you and her are able to expect you will be more prepared for the actual emotions from the episode which may also resolve your conflicted feelings about creating the eventthere are a lot of unknowns in the situation you are considering  having your partner who will be key in satisfying your sex wish be active in understanding these unknowns is a good way of keeping your relationship strong overall
459,i am experiencing panic attacks when i am physically separated from my girlfriend,i’m sorry to hear that you are currently experiencing panic attacks i hope that the medication you have been prescribed has provided you with some relief unfortunately i don’t feel that moving in with your girlfriend would alleviate your anxiety although you may feel very anxious about leaving her your body is reacting to this stressful event in your life in an unhealthy manner you may be able to render this particular situation but it’s likely that you may experience another panic attack when an additional stressful event arises therefore it is essential that you address the reason for why you are experiencing panic attacks in the first place followed by practicing coping mechanisms in the case that one would arise in the futuretalk therapy has shown to be effective with those affected by anxiety along with breathing exercises and yoga a trained therapist will be able to assist you in finding the right stress reducing method so that you can reduce the chance of another attack occurringi wish you the best of luck it sounds like you are very happy in your relationship and i hope you are able to reduce your anxiety so that you are able to enjoy one another
460,i am falling for my abusive and cheating exboyfriend,what you are experiencing is common with survivors of abusive relationships even abusive relationships have positive moments in them and typically for survivors those are things they still love and care about of the abuser a lot of it could also be grief over the loss of the relationship and also your children a lot of time people return to thier abuser because that’s the only support that they have if this is something you are going through i would encourage you to seek out a domestic violence non profit in your area because they can provide you with additional support  i don’t know the whole situation but keep in mind that abusers will make promises and say what they think the other person wants to hear to get them to return attached is an example of what i am talking about httpwwwbfwcorgpdfcycle%20of%20violencepdfbased on what you decide i would encourage you to keep  caution and boundaries it might be helpful to safety plan with a domestic violence non profit
461,i am going through depression right now and my relationship is suffering,hi there thank you reaching out for help it takes a lot of courage for someone that is being abused to reach out for help i want you to know that i am here to help you in any way that i can first and foremost you did not mention whether or not you had children yourself by this man i’m going to assume there are so the most important thing right at this moment is asking yourself if you and your children are safe is the boyfriend currently living in the home or is he coming and going if he is coming and going or currently living in the home my suggestion for you to is to pack a bag for you and your children and go somewhere safe  i cannot stress this enough although some people tend to minimize their abusers behavior  it’s those individuals that find themselves or their children in a serious situation so you can never take abuse lightly because you never know what is going through that persons mind at that particular time it’s always better to be safe than sorry secondly it will not be safe helpful or productive to attempt to talk to the abuser about your relationship abusers often times try and manipulate you into staying by apologizing or attempting to justify their behaviors this is the time you would want to go see a magistrate in order to get a protective order for you and your childrenit’s unfortunate that your significant other was involved with another women causing pregnancy however that is no longer your concern your concern at this point is keeping yourself and your children safe i would also suggest counseling for you and your children in order to work through these issues i hope this was helpful and please stay safe and take care of yourself
462,i am going through dysphoria,wonderful  i am so excited for you  what a huge decision  i am writing from toronto canada so it is hard for me to direct you specifically  i would start with two things 1 find a doctor that is comfortable perscribing hormones and 2 find a counsellor or therapist that is transgender specialized  they will know how transitioning works in your health care system and other supports as well  google is a wonderful way to find these resources   i wish you well thanks for writing
463,i am having a hard time with a breakup,probably being sad to lose the relationship would be a good next move for youwhen a relationship ends the daily life structure changes significantly  a break up means adjusting to differences in everyday life not only that the person is no longer connected with ussince your boyfriend is not talking to you then you are keeping yourself sadder than necessary to not accept his actions  there's nothing you or anyone else can do change the fact that when someone decides to stop talking this person is the only one who's in charge to start talkingmaybe since you have had several breakups w this person that you require more time to pass before you are willing to accept that his changed interest in the relationship is permanentbe patient with your uncertainty as to whether he will or will not resume the relationship  once enough time passes so that you are considerably past the point at which you and he come together then accepting his leavetaking will feel naturalright now its very understandable to have hope since you have been on this road before  in time you will have your answer as to whether your future is with him or not
464,i am having a lot of conflict in my relationship,being able to accept your partner's influence is a key relationship skill and it is very two sided  chances are if you do not feel your partner is being influenced by you they likely do not feel you are being influenced by them either the best fix you can practice is to soften yourself into your partner and see how much more open you can be to their influence  play with it
465,i am in a relationship and i think i like my exboyfriend who do i choose,hello the dynamics of having a romantic relationship with someone is not always clear sometimes we jump from one relationship to another without giving ourselves a chance to adjust and grieve for the one we had to leave behind when you find yourself in a situation where a previous partner is coming back into your life and desires to be with you again it is important to ask yourself what the motivations are prompting that return is the person afraid of being alone are they jealous of your current relationship do you feel the same way about this returning relationship as you did before it was ended how long andor how committed is the current relationship you are in now with your current partner does your former partner not like being dumped and maybe they just want to get back together with you so that they can dump you instead some of these questions you may not be able to answer and some of them might require your own internal reflectionyou likely want to make a good decision and you also might want to consider who it will impact and how that will happen other friends might be upset at this sudden change and it could create a strain on your friendship you will want to carefully consider the value of that friendship before you take any actions that could damage it also perhaps think about what led you to end the relationship with your previous partner in the first place has there been a change in events or behavior that would cause you to think of a valid reason to give that person a second chance how it will it impact your current relationshipgoing into relationships should be done with reflection patience and full awareness ultimately you choose who is in your life so you want to make those choices based on appropriate decision making and with the ability to protect yourself from harm no one else can make this choice for you however gaining the insight of friends or family can be helpful as can seeking out the counsel of a therapist in your heart you will likely find the right answer learn to trust that more as that is where the core of emotion tends to be when you need it use your mind to analyze things but allow yourself to also feel your way through the situation too the answer will arrive if you let it
466,i am in high school and i want to be a psychologist,it is a great idea for you to reach out to find a psychologist to talk to if this is a field you might be interested in pursuing regarding the length of schooling it generally takes 4 years of college and an additional 4 to 7 years of graduate school to earn a doctorate degree to become a psychologist there are also other similar professions including counseling that do not require a doctorate degree licensed counselors generally completed 4 years of college and an additional 2 years of graduate school if you are thinking about a career in psychology the local apa chapter would be a good place to start to find a local psychologist to talk to here's a link to the nj apa chapterhttpswwwpsychologynjorg
467,i am in love with a sex offender but my family does not accept him,thank you for your question trust is a huge thing in relationships and when that is broken or perceived as being broken it takes a long time to repair from what you shared it sounds like your boyfriend took steps to correct the situation and has shown to be trustworthy since unfortunately no matter how much we apologize for something we did or for something others perceive we did there will always be those with hardened hearts and will not forgive if you feel confident in your relationship then trust your inner wisdom we cannot control others but only ourselves respect your families wishes to remain in unforgiveness while at the same time ask them to respect your wish to believe in him and be in this relationship good luck to you
468,i am just not happy with my marriage,i’m sorry you are experiencing this and i’m glad that you are looking for help and support i’m not sure of all the details so take from answer what you can if you are feeling unsafe or scared in your relationship please know that there are non profit domestic violence services that can help and provide you some more support they can also safely plan with you if you choose to leave it seems that you might be feeling defeated and if that’s the case a lot of domestic violence non profits provide free counseling if you are needing to talk to someone what you are going through can be overwhelming and your are taking the right steps toward healing
469,i am losing my husband because my lack of sex drive,i’m sorry to hear about your current situation my heart goes out to you during this timefirst of all it is of vital importance that you discuss your symptoms with your doctor regardless of whether you are able to mend your relationship with your husband you need to address the physical issues you are experiencing more than likely heshe will be able to help you relieve some of these symptomssecondly you must be upfront and honest with your husband intimacy is a large part of a relationship and it is unfair to your husband that you did not disclose how you were feeling i think he would appreciate knowing that it was your medical problems causing the lack of sexual desire as opposed to the reason being himif you explain to him that you are addressing your sexual issues with your doctor in order to enhance your relationship he may be more willing to see that you are serious in wanting to mend the relationship the conversation will be hard to explain to your doctor and your husband since it is of such a personal nature but it will be extremely beneficial and please note that the reason for the feelings you were experiencing  was not your faultbest of luck to you and your husband
470,i am not comfortable with my girlfriend showing off her body on social media,ask her to consider your feelings not only her own defensiveness that she is called a whore by youclearly since you are writing on a site which offers psychological and emotional support and guidance you do not consider your gf to be a whoreshe may not realize or considered that you are somewhat protective of who sees her body   in the end she may not want the privacy over her body which you are encouraging her to haveat least you will have the satisfaction to know you stated your actual reasons for your request and did not rely on the ones she imagined you have
471,i am not sure if i have social anxiety disorder,it certainly sounds like you have some anxiety before deciding whether it was social anxiety or a more general type of anxiety i would wonder what it is that you think will result from you raising your hand or talking to someone you do not know here is some information on social anxiety httpssocialanxietyinstituteorgwhatissocialanxietyi would recommend talking to a local mental health professional it sounds like your anxiety is affecting your daily life and there are lots of strategies that may help to lessen thatthanks for being brave to post here
472,i am not sure if i want to trust my husband again,i am glad he is seeing a counselor  that is something that most men struggle with doing at times  time will tell if his actions are of good intentions  however remember that a person can only do to you what you allow them to do in relationships   what part did you play  did you down play his disrespect at one time  did you give up the power of your own voice  did you lose yourself in the relationship and it became just one sided  did you allow him to make you doubt yourself   in others words if you do decide to give him another chance what would you do different  not saying that you are the blame or cause of the negative words at all but do not allow such disrespect from him or anyone else in the future  if you do decide to give it another try go in with a voice with the demand of respect with your needs and wants expressed and expected  with an increase in your self worth and confidence you will know what to do if his actions are true or if with dishonest intentions   seek counseling as well if you need that additional support to find self
473,i am older and just experienced heartbreak,ouch losing someone you love hurts so much we all long to be loved and to love and to have that experience and then lose it is awful while it is easy to feel angry or start doubting yourself under these circumstances i would encourage you to recognize the agony of what you are experiencing as an indication of how much you value loving relationships and how much you want to make this happen in your life when we are going through this kind of loss it is really helpful to have the support of friends and family while no one is going to be able to make it better we do not have to be alone with our pain if you are not comfortable with going to those in your life it may be a good time to see  a counsellor to help you cope with your distress and learn how to move past this and find the love that you are looking for
474,i am overwhelmed and depressed,it sounds like you are feeling like things are hopeless and out of control and you are not sure what to do about it if you can find a competent therapist to work with together you may be able to come up with some strategies for alleviating the overwhelming distress that you are experiencing and gain some insight into what may be contributing to these challenges additionally a therapist may be able to support you in getting back on your feet in regards to work a place to live and showing up with your partner in a way that will be more satisfying to you
475,i am questioning my sexuality,hi brentwood while our society tends to want to put us into categoriesslotswhen it comes to sexuality because this is nice and neat and convenientmany people find that they do not fit perfectly into one or the other all you have to do is exactly what you are doing be aware of yourself and allow yourself to explore these thoughts and emotions both alone and in connection with a safe partner the people who love you will continue to love you as you sort through this you can resist the temptation to please others by giving yourself a label we are attracted to and fall in love with peopleand we cannot always predict what gender they might be i love how open you are to discovering yourself keep on that track 
476,i am scared because my boyfriend is interested in bdsm,"hello thank you for your question there are few things
that people find more personal than their sexual relationships when we feel
connected to our partner sex can be best thing since sliced bread however if
we feel disconnected in some way sex can feel degrading and even painful 
i don’t know the specifics about your relationship or how
comfortable you are in talking to your boyfriend but this is one of those
situations where communicating your fears is a good idea the only exception to
that would be if you believe he is actually a threat to you in some way if you
believe that then you should do whatever you think is safe it sounds like
there is a part of you that is already afraid of him and if that is the case
then remaining safe is your top priority 
assuming you are able to share with him your feelings
telling him what you are and are not interested in sexually is very appropriate
and sexually healthy sex is something that is supposed to be enjoyable for
all parties all parties should feel respected and able to say “no” to
absolutely anything they are not comfortable with 
i call the respectful agreement between sexual partners “sex
trust” sex trust means your partner respects your boundaries it means they
won’t degrade you sexually with hurtful words forced sex or forcing or
coercing sex in ways someone is not interested in having  your personal safety and mental wellbeing is
what is most important 
now if there is a part of you that is curious about bdsm
and may be interested in participating in it there are many websites that you
can explore to learn information i will warn you some websites and articles
are better or worse than others but you may at least feel more informed 
many people engage in bdsm and have happy relationships but
again it completely depends on what each person in the relationship wants it is
also important to know that bdsm is not just one thing and people practice it
differently based on comfort if it is something you are uncomfortable with
then you shouldn’t feel obligated to do it
 
i hope this was helpful be well

477,i am scared of hurting my boyfriend after he had a cyst removed from his testicles,are you talking with your boyfriend about his doctor advises on starting to have sex againbeing able to talk together about topics that involve both of you will establish a new type of intimacy on an emotional levelalso there are many ways of making love  if your bf's cyst has not yet healed then another way of both increasing your emotional intimacy and learning different love making suggestions is to read about these together with himi hope the two of you enjoy learning new ways of sexually taking care of one another while developing more emotional closeness in the process
478,i am scared of losing my girlfriend,well if you each want to be with the other than no one will be losthave you told her about feeling slighted  start telling her about your feelings  how she responds to you will tell you a lot about where her heart is and maybe too some of the reasons she has been so involved w the friendwho knows maybe the friend has problems of her own and your gf is spending extra time w the friend to help the friend and does not even know you feel hurtyou would do yourself and your gf a lot of good to tell more about your feelings  either you will get more closeness and consideration or not  at least you will have the truth
479,i am scared to go to a doctor or take antidepressants,i admire your courage for stating your view about antidepressants  questioning mainstream thinking and being in touch with your own views are signs of strength and clarity in a personas a therapist i always tell my patients to avoid antidepressantstheir effectiveness is in suppressing a persongs mood and feelings  if someone does not know how they are feeling then they will have more difficulty in understanding themselves their uncertainties and hesitations and overall how they relate to others and what they expect from othersantidepressants mask how someone feelsin a crisis temporarily taking antidepressants may be helpful  if someone is so overwhelmed that they are not functioning then  suppressing unhappy feelings so that the person can get through a day may be of benefit for a short whilebasically respect and follow your own opinion about antidepressants   your view is shared by many   it is a minority opinion and very valid if you would like to shop for a therapist ask the person on the phone what their opinions are about antidepressantsideally you will eventually find a therapist who thinks in a way which is similar to you or at least similar enough that you will have a sense that you are able to trust working with them on whatever you define as problematici hope you will have an easy and productive therapist search
480,i am scared to tell my family that i am bisexual,"hello and thank you for your question being bisexual can be particularly
difficult because it is often misunderstood even by people who are “supposed”
to be part of your own community such as lesbians and gays it happens so
often that there is actually a term for it – 
bierasure this is simply something that happens when people deny that
bisexuality is a real thing or discriminate against bisexuals due to beliefs
like your parents seem to have 
the unfortunate truth is that you can never
be sure of how you parents may take this kind of information it sounds
promising that they are accepting of other sexual orientations and it may
simply be that your parents lack education about bisexuality with accurate
information they may come around but there is no way to be sure 
some of my colleagues have already given you good information here are some more things that you can consider
and questions you can ask yourself before making the decision to tell them
 
1      if they don’t respond the way you want them to have you developed a support
system to support you through it this is very important the truth is that all
the friends in the world won’t prevent pain or sadness if your parents don’t
respond as you hope but they will at least be there to remind you that you are
okay as you are and that is critical for you to remember 
 
2      there is great information on the internet about bisexuality that you can
offer your parents if you think it would be helpful it may be important for
them to know the kind of damage that is being done to bisexual adults and young
people because of the myths surrounding bisexuality here is an article from
glaad about bierasure httpwwwglaadorgbisexualbierasure
 
3      coming out to people is obviously deeply personal and should only take
place when you are ready sometimes people get pressured from friends media
and even people they are romantically involved with to come out before they are
ready it really is up to you if you are feeling pressure from others don’t
feel bad about setting your boundaries and telling them that you will come out
on your own time intimate partners should respect you enough to understand
this 
 
4      something else to think about is your own comfort in being bisexual just
because someone is lgbtq doesn’t mean that they necessarily want to be many
people struggle with this having
your own doubts or insecurities may also play a part in how comfortable you are
in telling your parents so perhaps do some selfexploration about your
feelings toward yourself 
 
sometimes people take friends with them
when they decide to come out to their parents this is something you may want
to consider the important thing to remember is that you are okay really if
your parents don’t respond well that doesn’t mean that they never will some
start off upset but then work their way through it 
best of luck to you

481,i am seriously unhappy with everything in my life but i know i do not have any reason to feel this way,trust and believe your own feelingsemotions are real and reflect how someone feels about a situationsince you are sad about losing a loved one be patient w your feelings about this  basically be guided by how you feel and eventually you will feel different emotions which i hope will be happier ones
482,i am soon to be married and i have been messing around with others,hello and thank you for your question when faced with these kinds of difficult challenges i usually encourage people to look to their values for help in determining what their behavior should be indeed it is usually when our behaviors conflict with our values that we do not feel very content with our lives perhaps you can take some time to think through a couple of these questions what kind of person do i want to be deep in my heart what kind of character do i want to have when in public and in my private world when nobody is watching how would i want others to describe me let's say that you want others to see you as being authentic and you also value authenticity as something you want to live by you may feel like this value is currently at odds with the behaviors you are engaging in right now that you are not being the person that you really are deep in your heart this is not an unusual struggle when it comes to sexual behavior and sexual orientation so please try not to feel alone we all know quite well how unacceptable it may be to be seen as gay lesbian bisexual etc and i am not just talking about being unaccepted by others but a person may have a very hard time accepting themselves thinking about your values and living a life based on them can bring a lot of freedom but i will not lie it can also bring a lot of pain at the same time for example someone with the value of living authentically may decide they have to tell others who they are and what they stand for even if that means people may disapprove that may cause a lot of pain but it may also come with a sense of freedom to live a life based on honesty and authenticity it may be helpful to find a counselor who is trained in affirmative therapy which is recommended for people who are navigating their sexual behaviors and figuring out what is right for them i would also sit down and think through some of the questions above and consider what your values are both as an individual and as someone's fiancéabove all i wish you well in this journey robin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
483,i am starting to believe that i am gay,i agree with amy we get a lot of pressure from others and even ourselves to define who we are and what we want at a pretty early age the truth is our sexuality can change and grow in directions we never imagined i may be wrong but i am getting the impression that you may not want to be gay that this is something you did not like others suggesting and now you are uncomfortable with the idea that it may be true this would certainly be understandable your sexuality is yours and yours alone it can be quite frustrating and hurful when others try to define who you are and it can be equally frustrating when you are trying to figure it out for yourself the truth is that there are many different possibilities when it comes to sexual orientation it may help to think about what qualities you find attractive what kind of person can you see yourself being attracted to someone smart funny loves dogs if you look for these qualities in a person they may lead you to being attracted to someone of the same sex but maybe not at least you would be choosing someone based on values and qualities that you love and admire another idea is to chat with a counselor if you are interested preferrably one who has done some training in affirmative therapy be well and be yourobin  j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
484,i am struggeling with the idea of if god real or not,thanks for posting  this is a significant issue for many people and can make us feel helpless among other emotions due to the uncertainty  you said that at times you feel like everyone is lying ask yourself some of these questions  what is it that makes you feel so strongly that they are lying  where is the concrete evidence that they are lying how could i test my thoughts about this what if things are not what they seem on the surface am i any lesser of a person as a result of this persongs behavior or opinion  our beliefs about ourselves and the people and our world  and how we interpret information and experiences have a significant effect on how we feel and how we behave  it is important to objectively challenge the beliefs that contribute to negative emotions  you can start this process by answering some of the above questions  we are unfortunately influenced by what and who we associate with  as it pertains to if god is a lie be honest with yourself and question your beliefs that tell you that god is or is not real  it may be helpful for you to speak to a preacher or chaplain of some sort and they can help you with a lot of that  hope this helps at least a little bit
485,i am studying abroad and i am depressed,it sounds like you are feeling very unsure and out of place and the prospect of continuing to feel as you do now for the remainder of schooling seems daunting without getting to know more about you and your experiences here and at home it is hard to say what you should do however i think exploring these things with a competent therapist may help you to discover the answer
486,i am very depressed,you have already taken the brave first step of making the decision to heal from it and find a professional that will help you do so there are lots of different options nowadays for therapists as you can see them online or in an office  my biggest tip for you is to use psychology today or counsel chat to find a therapist  enter in your zip code and you will find many different therapists you can talk to  be sure to find someone that you most resonate with and ask them any questions you may have many  times therapists will provide free consultations and this can be a great opportunity to see if you are a good fit
487,i am with someone but i have unresolved feelings for my exboyfriend,if you are in a relationship and you are having strong thoughts about someone else it is important to pay attention to that although you say you are happy i would suggest looking really carefully at the relationship you have and whether you are getting everything you need is there a physical connection with your ex that you do not have with your current boyfriend it could be that your boyfriend is marvelous in many areas but that you just do not feel excited about him for some reason that is a pretty important element to be missingit may be that even if you are happy with your current boyfriend you still hold something special for your ex if you feel the need to see what is possible there i think you have to tell your boyfriend about that and end it with him first you cannot have everythingif you truly feel that you want to be with your current boyfriend you will do well to stop thinking about and focusing on your ex because thoughts of him will interfere with the growth of your current relationship the grass is not greener a therapist can help you to focus your energies and thoughts on the present rather than an imagined version of the past or future
488,i am worried about my new job,anxiety can cause such a feeling of discomfort in our bodies that it can seem unbearable the concern that i can hear in what you have written is that the thought of having some anxiety has now left you uncomfortable with any anxiety at all  and that can become a problem indeed as opposed to thinking about your anxiety as something much bigger than you it could be helpful to start breaking it down what are the things specifically that cause you anxiety about this new job is it being away from your family if so why once you start breaking down what causes you to feel anxiety into smaller mouthfuls then we are far better able to understand what has led to discomfort and start to problem solve the issue
489,i am worried that i will be single forever,i think one of the first questions that springs to mind for me is what's the rush  just because other people in your circle have had experiences that you are still warming up to does not mean that there's something wrong or something to be ashamed of  if anything i want to commend you on the selfrespect you have in wanting to wait and share this most intimate of experiences with someone that will feel the same way about it  one of the most common distortions in our thinking is when we try to directly compare ourselves to others while these people and even those in your family share a level of closeness to you they are not exactly like you  they do not see or feel things in the exact same way as you nor do they share the exact same perspective it is important to be making choices for you and for your own desires and life goals  once you stop comparing your happiness you may find that you are already experiencing it and allow more of your guard to fall down
490,i am worried that there's something wrong with the guy i love,keller it sounds like you are living this relationship in your mind instead of in the real world you can get answers to your questions by talking to himgetting to know him will answer all the curiosities you have you are asking the questions in your head instead of being in the friendship so what is it that gets in the way of actually asking the questions and getting to know him fear of rejection fear of something else if you have fear that keeps you from having fulfilling friendships i recommend a therapist to help you work through that i wish you well 
491,i have been feeling sadness,"feelings are real is very unlikely that you are making them up since they are a response to the thoughts in your mind and your daily experiences and interactions often we assume that feeling sadness is bad and that we should only feel happiness and joy but all feelings have a purpose joy sadness anger frustration excitement anxiety among others   is not healthy to experience the same feeling for a long time so we should learn to identify what causes them and how to process them so you can navigate through life experiences with more ease i am a licensed professional counselor in texas currently providing services in west houston  you may reach me at 7874665478 to schedule an appointment   me he estado sintiendo tristecuando salgo con una persona en particular o cuando llego a casa estoy triste o irritado  el sentimiento viene y va todo el día no sé qué está mal  no estoy seguro si estoy inventando los síntomas y problemas en mi cabeza o si algo realmente está mal los sentimientos son muy reales y es muy poco probable que los estés inventando por que los sentimientos son una respuesta tanto a los pensamientos que hay en nuestra cabeza y a las situaciones que nos ocurren día a día  muchas veces pensamos que sentirnos triste está mal y que solo debemos sentirnos alegres pero todas las emociones tienen un propósito y razón de ser tanto la alegría como la tristeza el coraje la frustración la excitación o el desespero entre otros  no es bueno quedarnos estancados una emoción  así que es importante aprender a identificar que causa nuestros sentimientos como procesarlos para poder superar nuestras emociones y movernos de una experiencia a otra con más tranquilidad

492,i have been having breakdowns for no reason at all,there is a reason you are having breakdowns i cannot agree that they happen for no reason at all   finding out the reason is going to be your biggest challenge because that may require you to dig deep into your past uncover hurtful experiences or recognize something that would be extremely pain  however if you do not find professional help to carefully guide you through whatever you may confront the symptoms mentioned will continue and may even get worse  there is a light at the end of the road but you need some help to find the right road to get on so you can see it
493,i have been having the same dream since i was a child,there is no scientifically established formula for understanding dreams that i know about however many people get a great deal of value from exploring what their dreams mean it is believed by many that our dreams contain metaphors that represent meaningful patterns in our lives and relationships and if we pay attention to them we can learn important things about ourselves one thing you might try to see if you can get more insight into the dream and possibly begin remembering things is to take note of whatever you do remember any details about your experience such as when do you wake up from the dream how do you feel both emotionally and physically what are you thinking about when you wake up is there any pattern in terms of what happens to you in your waking life around the time you have this dream if you can keep a journal or a recording device to speak into by your bed you can try to record whatever you do remember and notice as soon as you wake up people seem to have more difficulty remembering dreams the more time they let go by before attempting to record the dream or if you go back to sleep before recording what you remember
494,if i am trying to stop selfharming and i seek help will i need to be put in an inpatient setting,seeking professional help does not mean that you will necessarily be admitted into an inpatient setting  though  to be honest that can become an option if you feel unsafe or if you are unable to plan for safety however many clients who struggle with selfharm can find help in outpatient settings  particularly those which offer a treatment called dialectical behavioral therapy  looking for a dbt professional or group therapy setting may be particularly helpful but a skilled professional can help you to figure out how to identify other options even when you are experiencing overwhelming emotions without knowing your location i also recommend searching to find your local helpline or suicide prevention hotline the volunteers on the other end of the line can be very helpful even if your intention is not suicide and they are likely also to be able to connect you with resources in your area calling into the helpline may also be a first step alternative to selfharming when you are feeling overwhelmed
495,if i am not with my boyfriend i have emotional breakdowns,i would suggest that you look up the word codependency and it is characteristics  see if you relate to those characteristics  i have a feeling  you have suffered some form of loss in your life that you have not dealt with properly  for some reason you are depending on your boyfriend to fill that loss  considering working with a counseling to work through your emotions and resolve any lingering issues
496,if my kids come back from their dad's and act like they are afraid they will get hit should i be worried about him abusing them,this sounds frightening and overwhelming and i’m glad you are reaching out for help i can’t say for sure your children are being abused but i can understand your  suspicion since there appears to be a change your children’s behavior i think it would be important for you to keep an eye on the situation incase you notice any other changes if you become more concerned even  suspicions of child abuse are reportable to  family protective services if they feel it is necessary they can do an  investigation you are doing the biggest thing for your children by being there for them and supporting them
497,if parents are divorced is it acceptable for a counselor to allow an exspouse to be present during a child’s session,"i see a few issues herefirst the age of the child is important  if the child is considered an
adult by state law with regard to counseling states differ on this
 the range is typically between age 13 and age 18 no one is allowed to
be in the session without the child's consentsecond ethical and legal standards generally require that a
counselor be in the role of a therapist or in the role of an evaluator but
not both  this means that a counselor
should not generally provide both counseling and offer an opinion regarding who should
have custody of a childthird knowing the details of any parenting plan or
separation agreement is important 
generally either parent can consent to counseling for a minor child and
can be present during the child’s sessions 
if a court order parenting plan or separation agreement specifies that
one of the parents has sole decision making authority then only that parent can
consent to counseling for the minor child and only that parent can be present during the child’s
sessionsin a situation like this i would strongly recommend seeking
out legal advice specific to your state law"
498,is it a normal practice for a team of doctors who are connected by state or profession to discontinue your treatment,the general rule against medical abandonment says thst whenever healthcare providers discontinue treatment with you when you still need it they are legally required to make sure that you have access to another provider of equal or higher abilityin this case if your treatment team decided to discontinue your treatment based on a diagnosis of schizophrenia they still will likely be required to provide you with a referral to someone who can provide you with treatment if you have not already done so i would recommend that you explicitly ask for a referral
499,is it acceptable for me to find another home for my boyfriend's dog,every living creature needs time and support to adjust to a new situationthe dog is in a new place without the ability to understand the reason  this may explain what sounds like the dog's agitation  have you spoken with your boyfriend on his opinion on how to address the dog behavior problemsfinding an answer together would be a good way of making your relationship stronger  a lot of being a couple who live together is talking listening and deciding together on how to handle major situationsif it is affordable then a dog behaviorist may be of great help  the person would guide you in working with the dog to become calmer
500,is it appropriate to give my counselor a bottle of wine for christmas,this is a great question in general it is not appropriate for counselors to accept gifts from their clients there are some exceptions to this general rule  including a recognition that there may be a valid cultural aspect to this type of gift givingit might be best to simply offer your counselor a holiday card as an expression of your feelings you could also talk to your counselor about the gift and ask if him it if would be appropriatein the end i know he would most appreciate just knowing how much the counseling meant to you
501,is it bad that i am giving my exboyfriend another chance,hey it might be mistake in the end but this is a risk you want to take and you get to make your own mistakes your mom wants to protect you i get that maybe she is worried you will be hurt again were you hurt in some way by him can you understand where she is coming from sometimes when we are mad at our partner and we complain about them to mom it is hard to know how to repair mom's relationship with the partner when things are better and we reunite can you help your mom understand that you take responsibility for your part in how it went wrong that the picture you may have painted of him is not the total picture she might need help there thank your mom for her love and care and you can also let her know clearly that you and your boyfriend are the only ones who get to decide whether you are together or not that it is a risk you are going to take and that you really need her support 
502,is it ethical for a social worker to ignore a client’s phone calls,mental health providers should promptly return calls from current clients as well as from potential clients  this is even true if the social worker is unable to make an appointment with the caller  in that case the social worker should call you back to let you know that he is unable to schedule an appointment with youin addition mental health providers have an obligation to follow through with their own communication standards  for example if the social worker in this case has an outgoing voicemail message that promises returned calls within 24 hours he has an obligation to follow through on that promiseall that being said it is also worth remembering that mental health professionals are just people too it is possible that he had an unforeseen emergency that kept him from from returning your call promptlyin the end i agree with sherry's advice if you feel this social worker is not a good fit for you you probably should trust your gut and find someone else who is a better fit
503,is it healthy to embarrass a child as punishment,parents are to teach discipline to children not punishment   punishment is another word for wanting to cause hurt  there is a different in discipline and punishment  punishment could have long term affects on a child's self image and growth  it can lead to others issues such as bullying from peers as well  whatever your grandson has done there is a much better way of getting him to understand that his actions are not acceptable  punishment is not one them  encourage the stepmother to build a positive relationship with him this way he will learn to respect and trust her  his actions would improve  she may need to attend a parenting class for blended families
504,is it normal for my mom to get mad easily,you are very wise for a young person you have already figured out that other people's behaviourshow they treat youit is not about youit is about them i love that you do not blame yourself for your mom's behaviours it is not your fault she is getting upset because she does not know how to manage her emotions and these emotions have to do with her past and her present stress you are just the trigger yes this is normal but it is not necessary she can find another way to manage her stuffunfortunately you cannot help your mom a whole lot or even help her recognize this but for yourself remembering that her behaviours are her issue is the biggest piece of dealing with it you can always try some new strategies when you talk to momyou can say i will listen you better if you do not bring up past stuff or i am worried about you mom you seem stressed or even i do not like the way you talk to me good luck
505,is it normal to be more sensitive when i am not intimate with my boyfriend,well yes physical intimacy does give all sorts of positive feelings  the sudden withdrawal of these is certainly possible to trigger a reaction like the one you describe
506,is it normal to blame myself for someone else's actions,"hello and thank you for your question you are clearly a
resourceful young person to reach out like this to find help good for you i
have a few ideas and perhaps some other counselors will add some thoughts too

first good for you for taking care of yourself and making
really good decisions – such as not getting into the car with dad when he is
intoxicated it is really important that you consider your safety above all
else 
to answer your heading question yes it is quite common for
people to blame themselves for other people’s actions there are various
reasons why we do this for one thing someone may tell us that their behaviors are our fault and depending on things like our relationship to that
person past experiences and our selfesteem we may actually start to believe
it what is important to remember is that your parents have the responsibility
to be sure that you are safe and
cared for not the other way around 
as for the other things you mentioned i am concerned about both
your physical and emotional safety and wellbeing it sounds like your father
has an alcohol abuse problem and living with someone who is struggling with
addiction can be hard for anyone let alone a teenager who is also trying to
deal with things like school 
you may want to see if your school has a counselor or
someone you can talk to about what is going on i will tell you that in some
states what you have told me may be something that a counselor would have to
report to child protection services but not necessarily if you are concerned
about that ask the counselor what they are obligated to report 
if you don’t know a counselor think about any other adult
that you would feel comfortable talking to they may have some ideas 
sometimes individual states have nonprofit chat lines or
hotlines for teens to call if they are struggling with things you may be able
to find something like that in your state i do warn your about doing random
searches not every website is good so be careful 
this is clearly a tough spot for you to be in so one of the
things that i encourage you to do while searching for support is to focus on
taking care of yourself sometimes things like this can really bring us down and
we stop doing the things we enjoy try really hard not to let that happen if
you have interests do them if you catch yourself thinking too hard about
things try to find something fun to do to distract yourself try to take care
of yourself in other ways such as eating well exercise can really help when
we get stressed 
i hope some of this was helpful good luck

507,is it normal to cry at therapy,it is more than just normal it is expected quite honestly there are a very few days where at least one client has not cried during therapy throughout the day ijp
508,is it normal to cry during therapy,oh crying in therapy is very normal i have a stack of kleenex boxes in my office cry away therapist are very used to it first time being in therapy is scary but you will soon know if you are a good match
509,is it normal to dislike one child,this is your experience your feeling and you are wondering if it is normal which means is this common or the rule this question about how you feel about your third child leads me to believe you are dis turbed   feelings are messages from our soul or spirit that something is not right  so though  it might be normal  to look forward to a one year olds nap time when you have a three year old a nine year old the dis turbance or stirring up in you is important and requires your attention your listening if you will to your higher self
510,is it normal to go into therapy feeling nervous,hello first i am so sorry you are experiencing these feelings they can be intense i will do my best to offer some suggestions or thoughts that i hope will be helpful to you there could be a number of things occurring therapy is a delicate private decision and i would first like to commend you for the fact that you are not giving up that you are working to figure this out and make this work it sounds like you are engaged and motivated to receive support from a professional your continued  dedication and motivation will take you far i would first start by asking if you have discussed this with your therapist if you feel comfortable enough telling your therapist what is going on maybe inform the therapist that  that you feel nervous and shaky i am a firm believer in open communication between the client and therapist as this builds a healthy therapeutic relationship that yields positive outcomes if this can be obtained and well received this is your time for healing and therapy should be a safe supportive environment to not only process but to seek support and guidance from a professional who can help you move past the barriers if you feel you are comfortable and able to speak to your therapist that would be my first suggestion is to tell he or she how you are feeling if they know then they can help determine the potential cause and allow you to process and move forward if this is left un resolved it will be hard for you to move forward if you are not comfortable discussing this with your therapist this may be something to take into consideration and worthy of thinking about why you are not comfortable speaking to the therapist i understand this is difficult if i may offer one more suggestion breathing exercises are very beneficial remind yourself what you are working to achieve close your eyes in a safe moment and breathe in and out slowly in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth with pursed lips breathe in for approximately 510 seconds then let it out slowly be sure and do this when you are in private and feel safe environment when you begin i suggest putting your hand on your stomach over your belly button to feel yourself actually taking in those deep breaths i know it may sound kind of silly but they really work and are incredibly helpful we often forget to breathe especially when we  are feeling anxious you are supported here and try taking yourself through the above thought process and breathing and practice the breathing several times a day i hope this shaky and uneasy feeling eases wishing you the very bestlaura cassity lmsw lmac
511,is it normal to hate my mom,it sounds like you are hating some of the things that your mom does rather than hating hersomething you may be able to do is call the area agency on aging for the county where you live and ask for information about having other people help to care for your mom i do not know how old your mom is but if she is younger they would probably have resources to other ways that you could have help if you are both open to the possibility of someone else helping out this may help with some of the difficulties between you if you are not spending quite as much time together do you think your mom is able to actually recognize how what she does and says affects youfrom whom do you have support during all of this
512,is it normal to take a parent role and feel so hurt and broken as a teenager,it sounds like you have a lot of weight on your shouldersi am not sure what you mean when you say you are not stable and you are breaking down if you are crying because you are sad that is okay if you are crying a lot or having trouble eating or sleeping that is different than just crying sometimes because you are sad it may be helpful to talk with a local mental health professional in your area they can help you to figure out what you could do differently to have the role in your family that you would like while also supporting yourself and what you want
513,is it ok ayto talk with my grown children about spending time with their children,you seem to have been a very positive influence in your kids' livesthey may have worked so hard because they understood how difficult and tiring your life was as a single momi feel you are seeing your kids' lives through the measurement of how much toil was in your life as a single momin other words what you see your kids overlooking or not appreciating may remind you of your wishes during the many years you raised your kidsif it helps you and is possible then maybe you could spend more of your own time tougher with your grandkids  this may give some reward for the many years you spent working to support your kids and had no choice in the amount of time you had with your kidsas far as your kids relationship to their kids it is now their turn to raise them as they wish within ethical boundaries of coursedepending on the topics you and your kids talk about consider to bring up your concern as to whether they feel their kids your grandkids are missing anything due to the limited time they have with the parents
514,is it okay for my girlfriend to have sex with other men since i can’t sexually perform,hi first and foremost i want to acknowledge your efforts to gain ideal erectile function if the medications are not working and you have taken them as prescribed i would encourage you to seek the help of a sex therapist as the dysfunction may be due to a psychological andor relational issue rather than a physicalmedical one as for your question only you can answer this is it ok are you ok with her sleeping with others have you thought through what this may look like feel like become for you and her opening up a relationship is a choice only the people in the relationship can answer even then the answer may change at any point by either of you i encourage you to also determine what the intention is underneath your telling your girlfriend she could sleep with others be clear with the intention and then together have continuous conversations about the expectations of opening up  an excellent resource would be the book opening up by tristan taormino i wish you the best of luckdr lily zehner mftc
515,is it okay if i take my friend's pills away,hello thank you for your question i have a worked with many people who have become addicted to benzodiazepines like clonazepam it is a difficult road for people who are trying to become clean it is also a very difficult road for those who love the person and are trying to be supportive during those times it is important to remember to take care of yourself too as for taking your friend's pills my concern would be the legal ramifications that you could face should you ever be caught with someone else's prescription medication and especially these types of medications our laws have become much more strict surrounding prescription drug sales and possession due to the increase in prescription drug abuse in addition people who are in active addiction are likely to find some other means to get their drug so it would do little to help the overall problem i do not know about your friend's family situation but they may be a better route to take if you are concerned about your friend they may already be involved but with your help you may be able to convince your friend to go to treatment willingly that is usually better in many states there are also involuntary committal processes where a persongs family may be able to convince a court to force the person into treatment this varies from state to state if your friend's family is not aware of this option it may be something to look into it usually does take a relative or a medical provider to begin this process if it is available i hope this was helpful and i wish you and your friend well robin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
516,is it okay to date my exboyfriend’s cousin,does your boyfriend agree with the other people's opinions or is the problem that he feels that doing what they want will be an easy way to stop hearing them say what he does not like hearingtalk through whether he actually believes what the others are telling him or figures that complying will make them stop bothering himonce the two of you understand what if any the differences are in the opinions you each have on the double relationship status you will be more clear whether the differences can be aligned somehow
517,is it possible for a couple to overcome cheating if it only happened once,helloyes many couples have survived infidelity how sincere is he with wanting to work it outthat means alot in recovery the key is to understand that cheating is a choice please do not take the betrayal personallook at the foundation of the relationship  is there cracks that can be healed how do you feel about betrayal honest communication is the key to healing never assume monogamy discuss it no one can tell you if you should stay or go that is a very personal decision start by setting up face to face time to discuss the affair and emotions  if this may be hard please get a counselor or therapist that can meditate this journey just remember even if you decide to leave you still need support to heal just because you leave the situation  the trauma still exists
518,is it possible for a person to stop feeling emotions,terrible things do happen in life and i am sorry to hear about what happened to you please rest assured that you are not a sociopath and that your reactions are normal responses to traumatic events i am guessing you are experiencing a sense of numbness which is a common response to trauma the best thing you can do is to get some trauma counseling with a professional counselor  as you process your experience you will be able to feel emotions again however the first feelings to come back may be related to trauma such as fear panic and a sense of hyper vigilance a professional counselor will be able to help you tolerate these feelings manage them and heal from your trauma
519,is it possible that i have depression,it is possible that you have depression but you could also be experiencing some other changes that mean that you have feelings of being sad without actually being depressed your statement makes it sound like you have stopped caring about your work but you are still going to work and doing your work it almost sounds like you are dissatisfied with your work do you like what you do when you said that life is pointless what makes it that way what is keeping you going is there something you can do each day that you can find meaning inyou mentioned that you are not sure if you need help or are just tired it sounds like you could certainly benefit from talking with someone about more specificsi am curious about how long you have felt this way and if you are aware of anything that is contributing to it
520,is it possible to gain joy and prosperity in my relationship after years of unhappiness,hi winters i learned a long time ago that i cannot ever predict who will change and who will not i meet couples who seem to have all the ingredients but cannot make it work and others who have severe issues and they decide to make better decisions and things change but in reading your story the image of a slot machine came to mind you are gambling your life away on the chance that this guy will change only you can decide how many years to give it i see him giving you clear signs that he does not even believe in himself or want to change though what are you waiting foralthough you say you know his behaviours are not your fault something tells me that you are hoping your love for him will turn the key that unlocks something and makes him want to change it does not work that way just like the slot machine you have no power to change him or make this work you can only decide when you have paid too much i bet there's someone out there who loves and misses you he is not your only support
521,is it possible to get ptsd from being very depressed,a ptsd diagnosis requires an event which occurred at least 6 months prior to the symptoms   depression is a common symptom of ptsd but depression can come from many other sources as well  in the end diagnoses are systems of behavioral labels  if you believe that one label is worse than another  you are creating a false hierarchy   consider consulting a cbt therapist such as the fine clinicians listed in academyofctorg  you may also want to look at my book living yes for many ideas about challenging your thinking and improving you mood wwwlivingyesorg i hope you feel better soon  mark  
522,is it possible to get my exboyfriend help forcibly,the specific laws about this will vary from state to state  generally the only way to force someone to get mental health care is if they pose an imminent theft of harm to themself or someone else or if they are unable to care for themself  more importantly is dealing with your safety  most states have laws that make stalking a crime you might want to think about filing a police report and obtaining a restraining order against him  you could also think about contacting a local counselor while you cannot force him to get help with moving on from the relationship counseling could help you to deal with what is going on
523,is it time to end my relationship with my boyfriend for good,hello and thank you for your question i worked for a number of years with people who have been both abused in their relationships and those who have been abusive being involved in a relationship with a partner who does the behaviors you describe can be incredibly difficult and many would argue is even harder than overcoming actual physical violence i was a little confused about whether you are are still broken up with this person or if you are still thinking about it i am going to assume you are still undecided some of the things you are describing sound like emotional abuse even without physical abuse being emotionally abused can still be traumatizing when partners question and accuse they are often trying to exercise power and control over their partners by hurting them with unfounded accusations  the accusations serve to make someone feel guilty and to manipulate them for example if your partner accuses you of cheating when you go out bowling with friends you may elect not to go bowling just to satisfy your partner and prevent a fight from occurring the person being accused or questioned often tries to prove over and over again that they have done nothing wrong but it does not matter and that brings me to the point of what some people who experience these behaviors do in order to start feeling like they have some power again here are just a few things1 they realize there is no right answer trying to be logical with someone who does not want to be logical does not work many people simply stop trying to defend themselves against false accusations because there was no answer that would satisfy their partner anyway in addition the rules of the relationship seem to change on a daily basis and what may be okay with your partner one day may make them angry the next and this can leave people constantly feeling like they are on eggshells  2 the find support finding a support group or a group of people who remind you on a daily basis that you are a decent person is always a good idea one of the things that can happen when we are with someone who does emotionally abusive things is begin to have a negative concept of ourselves surrounding yourself with people who remind you that you are a good person is a great idea 3 they reinvest in themselves try to find some time for yourself this could not possibly sound more cliché but it is actually true whether that is taking up a new hobby or doing an old one one thing that can happen when emotional abuse takes place in a relationship is the person being abused can begin to isolate and not do the things that make them enjoy life taking some time for the self can sometimes bring things into perspectivei do not know if you are still in counseling but if you are and you are getting what you need then that is great if not there are others you can try it is important to find the right fit as for the question of whether or not you should leave your partner that is a question that can only be answered by you but you could ask yourself some questions  like these to help you decide1 what are some of my values about relationships do i want trust honesty ask yourself if you have these things in your relationship2 do i feel like this relationship brings out the best in me or does it seem to bring me down3 if i want to stay in this relationship what are some specific things that need to change hope some of these suggestions help good luck to you be wellrobin landwehr dbh lpc ncc
524,is it unethical to have a relationship with a fellow counselor,generally the ethical codes only prohibit relationships with clients there are however a few types of counselortocounselor relationships that are prohibited by the ethics codes such prohibited relationships include those between supervisors and supervisees between professors and students or any time the relationship might negatively impact your clients lastly some workplaces have rules against dating coworkers it would be a good idea to check if there is such a rule that applies to you
525,is it weird or dangerous to give myself advice through an imaginary friend,hi i am amelia you know it does sounds like you have imagined a motherly comfort figure for yourself sometimes when i have a person in my office that is very selfcritical i have himher speak to his or herself as though heshe were speaking to a loved one is not it sad that we speak to others more lovingly than we do ourselvesif you have not received empathy nurturing or comfort from a caregiver it is hard to internalize empathy nurture or comfort from the inside there is a saying that we have been hurt in relationships and we can heal in relationships healing and growth are best provided in the context of healthy relationship how about going the next step and finding a compassionate therapist or loving mentor that could actually provide you with the comfort that you need you deserve to be seen heard noticed and valued i am wishing my very best to you
526,is it wrong for me to be attracted to my girlfriend,you are not a pedophile you are both under 18 and your age is appropriate for a relationship there would be a possible problem if she was 10 or younger pedophelia is a whole other problem that you probably should not be worried about i would be happy to talk with you in more detail about this
527,is it wrong that i do not love or even like my sister,not liking someone is not cruel  even if it is a family member there is nothing wrong with you for not liking your sister some people are fortunate to have siblings that they get along with really well other do not we all have different personalities and we are not going to like everyone  even if they are related in fact sometimes being related makes it harder because you know all of each other's flaws and imperfections with that being said  it may be worth it to make an effort to talk about the things that get in the way of having the kind of relationship that you might ideally want with your sister sometimes it is hard to like someone if we have a lot of old frustration and resentment and being able to talk about it in a constructive and kind way can lead to more understanding and respect and sometimes actually liking each other
528,is it wrong to be antisocial around people,hi buffalo i think you are right your partner's reactions are about him i have to say it is a cruel thing to say to someone you lovethat you are embarrassed by them the subtext says you are not good enough and i love that you can reject that false messageyou do not have to be different for anyone if he cannot accept you for who you are what is he doing with you your social habits are not a reflection on him it is just you being you also and i am sure you have found thisthe more he judges you the more difficult it is for you to be the confident outgoing person he wants you to beso his method of trying to change you does not even worki think that is the cruxhe is trying to change you what does that make you want to do
529,is it wrong to cheat on my husband,"hello and thank you for your question the question about
whether or not to cheat is based on personal values that can only be answered
by you however here are a few things to consider and questions to ask
yourself to help you find your answer
1    
do you feel like you are violating your own
values or morals this is important because we all have different values and
morals surrounding sex love and monogamy if you value monogamous
relationships and find yourself cheating on your partner then you may feel
like you are living in contradiction to your values and most people are not
happy when they do that however if monogamy is not something you value then
perhaps it is time to reevaluate the relationship and determine if it is still
right for you not all people want monogamous relationships and that
is alright finally if you value your husband’s feelings and know that the
affairs would hurt him then your behaviors may again be in contrast to your
own values that can only be determined by you 
2      based on how you describe your relationship it
sounds like you are not very satisfied with the way it is  from the outside it looks like the affairs
are a way to “get even” with your husband or to feel better after an argument this
is something that can happen when mutual respect starts to fade in a
relationship and gets replaced with contempt we can simply stop caring about
how our actions hurt each other or potentially hurt each other perhaps the
question to ask here is when you look out toward the future with your husband
is this the pattern that you want to keep the pattern of very little sex
argument and then satisfying the pain or dissatisfaction with affairs 
 3      what are your goals for this relationship if we
start to become disconnected in a relationship we can begin to do things on
autopilot get up get the kids up go to work come home and go to bed none
of which requires any intimacy at all are you still able to see the hopes and
dreams you once had for this relationship
 4     
have you considered seeking marital counseling not
having affairs won’t actually fix the part of the relationship that is leading
you to have them if there is something broken it sometimes requires some help
to get it fixed 
 hopefully these questions and thoughts will help you come to
some kind of conclusion about what is right for you and your relationship i certainly
wish you well

530,is my depression sabotaging my job search,it sounds like you are feeling pretty overwhelmed and stuck between wanting to improve your work situation and worrying that you will not be able to it is possible that the paralysis uncertainty and selfdoubt that you describe are contributing to your difficulty in getting  and maintaining a satisfying job as employers generally like to see that a potential employee is confident and can think on his or her feet with a competent therapist you may be able to get more understanding of the roots of these feelings and learn how to move forward in your search for a better work life in a way that leaves you feeling confident and capable
531,is my exboyfriend a pathological liar,it sounds like you have some ambivalent feelings towards your exboyfriend that are difficult to sort out you notice that there are both desirable and undesirable things about him and this is true of everyone to one degree or another one question that i would have for you is are you satisfied with your relationship with him as it currently stands are you happy with the boundaries between the two of you or would you like them to be different negotiating through conflict and establishing different boundaries are definitely things you could work on with the help of a therapist another question i would have for you is what would it mean for you to find out what motivates his behavior discovering the roots of such behavior is something that he would have to work on in his own therapy and not something that you and a therapist could discover without him
532,is my husband having a midlife crisis,it is hard to say that it is a midlife crisis stage  could be but so much more seems to be going on or have been going on to say with confidence that it is not much more
533,is my marriage worth saving,for how long has the arguing been occurring and does it relate to a specific incident or circumstance in your relationshiparguing due to temporary stress and feeling lost or uncertain is different than the two of you rarely agree on what foods to buy at the grocery storein both temporary or longer term arguing ask yourself if the points being argued are core principles of yours or matters which you can accept in service to the benefits you feel from the marriageif your core principles are rejected you’ve been arguing for an extended amount of time and the value of the marriage doesn’t outweigh this then seriously consider if ending the relationship is a better option than to stay in it
534,is my moodiness just a phase or do i need help,sometimes the way to feel happy is to address all the questions you just describedteenage years are the first time any of us starts to feel and recognize our uniqueness  the fact that you recognize your great range of feelings as uncomfortable as they may sometimes be is healthyalso healthy is that you are asking for opinions of therapists who would be familiar with when a range of feelings shows an out of the ordinary problemone path to take is to reflect on the topics you wrote here and especially to ask yourself your reasons for how the problem started and what it would take for it to resolvedo you have trust issues because someone broke your trust you are entitled to a repair of your trust by the other person   even if the person never offers this to you to know you deserve to be restored to whole may help you feel more securethe same is true with the other topics abandonment and relationships generallythe more you continue to value your unique understanding expectations and standards the more likely you will create relationships which do not have these qualities and you will restore your sense of hope that other people may treat you in a fair and kind way
535,is my relationship with my stepdad normal,it is hard to tell from the way you described it do you think he would be open to an honest discussion it could be that his comments about your outfit are designed to make you feel good or to help them show how much he cares about you as his stepdaughter as far as scanning you from head to toe i can think of reasons that parents might do that i also think that talking about it is probably very important so you really know what his intentions are that way it removes the guesswork and you have the opportunity to know what he is thinking and feeling and he can also know what your reactions are
536,is my therapist telling my abuser the results of my test a hipaa violation,it sounds like it may have been a violation of confidentiality for your therapist to disclose information about you without your permission  there are some exceptions to the general rule of confidentiality however  for example when a therapist has a reasonable concern that a client is in imminent danger he or she is generally allowed to disclose confidential information to protect that personif you believe your counselor has violated your confidentiality you can always contact your states' counseling regulatiory board  the board will then investigate the allegations and can take appropriate action
537,is screaming and cussing at your child considered emotional abuse,oh my goodness my heart goes out to you  i pray you have other strong and supportive loved ones or friends surrounding you if you are in school please consider speaking with a counselor on site who can help give you some good coping mechanisms as well as other resourcesi believe most therapists would agree that this type of behavior is indicative of emotional and verbal abuse and quite often the two overlap because someone who is being yelled at and demeaned is also frequently having hisher emotions preyed upon as well healthy place offers us some great examples of emotional abuse which certainly fit the criteria of what you describeyelling or swearing name calling or insults mockingthreats and intimidationignoring or excludingisolatinghumiliatingdenial of the abuse and blaming of the victimand abuse survivor and author kellie jo holly offers some other great examples of verbal abuseemotionally abusive statementsyou’re so cute when you try to concentrate look at you trying to thinki can’t believe i love a stupid jerkaw come on can’t you take a jokesexually abusive statementsyou should know how to please me by nowi hoped you were less experiencedstop acting like a whorefinancially abusive statementsyou are going to nickel and dime me to deathin what world does buying that make sensefine you handle your finances let me know when things go to hellsocietally abusive statementshow dare you spread around our private businesslet me do the talking people listen to menyou took a vow in front of god and everybody and i expect you to honor itthreatening and intimidating statementsif you don’t train that dog i’m going to rub your nose in its messi will take our kids if you leave meyou’re scared this isn’t angry you will know when i’m angryspiritually abusive statementkeep your stupid beliefs to yourselfgod will find a way to get you back and it ain’t gonna be prettyi can feel myself being pulled into hell just listening to your nonsenseit is been my personal clinical experience that children who are experiencing the types of things you describe often say they feel misunderstood lonely or scared and do not want to make things worse by standing up for themselves even if you feel you cannot defend yourself outwardly that does not mean your father's awful and toxic behavior is something you should ever internalize which is why i hope you are surrounding yourself with people who will speak life and positivity back over you  we are all worthy of respect love and kindness do not ever forget thatmy love and light to you hontamara powell lmhc
538,is selfdiagnosing okay,any diagnosis is limited in its usefulnessknowing the name of some typical ways you may feel think and behave does not help you or anyone to understand why the person is the way they are and how to change any of these characteristicsboth selfdiagnosing and being diagnosed are equally unhelpful to know why you are the way you are and what to do about itconsider yourself a person who wants to find a better way to be who you are and this will get you further with better results than to read a list of descriptions which all are very indicting and negative sounding
539,is there a lawsuit for counselors and therapists who failed to report a relapse,i am so sorry to hear of your loss  this sounds like a really difficult situation for the whole family  since the answer to this question will depend a lot on the applicable state laws i would suggest talking with a local attorney  that being said i see two competing issues here  on the one side is the duty of confidentiality the counselors owed to your relative  on the other side is the duty the counselors had to act reasonably to protect your relative from harm  generally there is not a requiremt for substance abuse treatment centers to notify family members if an adult client relapsesa local attorney will be able to provide more specific guidance on the legal obligtions and liabilities in this situation
540,is there a reason i have always been attracted to men much older then me,sometimes the reason for being attracted to older men is because of growing up with a father who was distantif you grew up having enough interaction with your dad to know you would have liked more and did not receive this then maybe your longings of childhood are still active within youit is ok to like older menjust be sure you are not idealizing them or anyone elsebecause regardless of age a relationship is based on who the two people really are not how we would like imagining them
541,is there anything i can do about my depression and anxiety,thank you for asking this important question i find that there are three steps to getting ready for treatment step one is expressing interest in wanting to receiving treatment for the outcome of positive behavioral change congratulations you did the first step you are showing your readiness to start counseling by asking this question now the second step is to find a counselor who specializes in treating clients with anxiety and depression the therapeutic orientations i have found to be helpful in treating clients with  anxiety and depression are a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy with mindfulness and solution focused brief therapy receiving meditation for your symptoms if part of the treatment and the other part is receiving counseling to increase your resilience for future events research has found that medication and psychotherapy treatments together shows the most effective outcome for depression  the third step is to increase your positive selftalk to motivate yourself to attend treatment as counselors we are aware of the anxieties and fears that are associated with talking to a new professional for the first time however remind yourself that you are doing this to improve your well being i hope this was helpful and good luck with your treatment journey
542,is there anything i can do about my therapist blocking my psychiatric services,my recommendation would be to try to talk to your therapist about this  from your description it sounds like you have a legitimate explanation for missing your scheduled session maybe if you could explain that to her she would be willing to work with you if she is not willing to consider your explanation and if she is not willing to continue working with you she still has an ethical obligation to provide you with referral resources to another therapist
543,is there anything i can do to help my siblings escape our emotionally abusive father,yes you can help  emotional and verbal abuse can cause a negative impact in your family  it is important that you encourage your siblings to seek assistance with a therapist and maybe help them find one they should have school counselors available and if not our college counselor may help you to get referrals  it’s also a good idea to talk to your mom about the issue and ask her if she would like help as well  if you are concerned about your siblings' safety contact family protective services in your state they will investigate and refer your father to classes or therapy as needed it takes courage to do the right thing you can do this¿hay algo que pueda hacer para ayudar a mis hermanos a escapar de nuestro emocionalmente abusivo padreactualmente estoy en la universidad así que no soy victima directamente  mi padre es muy abusivo con sus palabras y acciones y trata a mis hermanos horriblemente¡tu si puedes ayudar  el abuso emocional y verbal puede causar daños graves en la familia  es importante que motives a tus hermanos a visitar e incluso encontrar a un terapista la escuela debe tener uno disponible y también puedes pedirle referidos a tu consejero universitario  también es buena idea que hables con tu mama al respecto y le preguntes si a ella le gustaría buscar ayuda  si te preocupa la seguridad de tus hermanos contacta a el departamento de protección a la familia en tu estado para reportar el abuso  ellos investigaran y determinaran si el hogar es un ambiente seguro par tus hermanos y recomendaran terapia o clases para tu papa  hay que ser valiente para hacer lo correcto ¡tú puedes hacerlo
544,is there anything i can do to make my anxiety go away,with the way you described your anxiety it sounds like you have different types of anxiety i am not sure whether you have anxiety of public places large crowds being alone   or some combination thereofone thing that would be helpful would be to track your anxiety and see how anxious you are in different situations also if you know what leads up to your anxiety it would be good to know this as well so you can look for patternsas for forgetting things you could be anxious because you are forgetting things or you could be forgetting things because you are anxious when you are having anxiety certain parts of your brain are overactive because you are in a kind of protective mode it is also possible that forgetting things and anxiety are not relatedsomething else to try would be to notice where you feel your anxiety in your body and put your hand there is a way of giving yourself comfortanother thing about anxiety is that having anxiety can lead to more worry about having more anxiety one thing that helps for some people is to go to the regular primary care doctor to make sure that there are no physical problems so they know that there are no physical problems and that the anxiety will lessen in a few minutesalso if you are able to notice your feet on the floor or your hips in the chair this is helping you to be mindful of your body and connecting you to your surroundings during this in combination with naming your emotions can be soothing as well for example in the grocery store if you are feeling anxious you could say to yourself i am anxious right now and i am okay while gently shifting your weight from one foot to the other no one around you would notice what you were doing and the motion may be soothing to youanxiety can have a lot of different causes and things that trigger it if it is difficult for you to work it out on your own  consider talking with a local therapist so you can have more specific ideasalso consider making a list of people who you trust and what it is about them that makes you feel comfortable
545,is there something i should do to help my friend who is in an abusive relationship,i’m glad that you  are seeking help and that you are supporting your friend i’m sure this is all overwhelming and frustrating for you the biggest thing you can do for your friend is to be supportive as you are already doing unfortunately there isn’t much you can do for her outside of that because it is up to her husband to change and up to your friend if she wants to leave there are things you can do to support more it might be helpful for her to have some information on a domestic violence non profit in her area because they can assist her in many areas if she wants to leave they can also provide you with support while you go through this with her the nonprofit can also safety plan with her and it might be helpful for you to do it with her if you want to another thing you can do is support her in decision to stay with her husband or not despite what she decides many victims decide to stay with thier abusive partner for many reasons it is important to support her decisions even if you don’t agree with them because she may have very little decision making in her relationship i would also encourage you to make sure you are taking care of yourself while you support her so you are not becoming too overwhelmed here is some info that might be helpful to you httpsabuseinterventionorgsandbox77wpcontentuploads201203howtohelpalovedonepdf
546,is this depression,it is hard to make a definite diagnosis however i would say  that it could be and or a combination of depression stress ptsd etc  more background information would have to be needed  one thing i would say is that you really need to seek guidance from a professional to work through these symptoms  if what you described as a caged animal is released all the crying sadness and controllable emotions will come out  that would not be good when they do  get help before they do
547,is wishing i was not born a sign of something deeper,sounds like a sign of great unhappiness or sadness or insecuritythe real way you will find out what this feeling is about is to ask yourself your own question  inside you are the only one who will feel when you discover the true answer to your questioneveryone feels some amount of discontent in their lives once in a while its normal to not feel entirely happy all the timetry to accept your unhappiness as motivation to learn more about who you are what you like whom you likestudy yourself bc this way you increase the chance to find a road which feels right and happy
548,i’m afraid that i’m gay,are you able to give yourself some peace of mind while you take the time to further address whether or not you are gaywhether or not and to what degree a person accepts their sexuality depends on dense factors such as the culture of your family the beliefs about gay people with which you were brought up and your own tolerance for being a unique individualexamining these factors whether inwardly by yourself in online blogs and sites or live with other people requires patience and effortthe more you are willing to commit to figuring out your own truth the greater is your chance of finding it

550,i’ve been separated from my husband for six months and he still has not filed for divorce,in any relationship including marriage each partner will be better able to do their part by understanding their own interests and wishesconcentrate more on what you would like from your marriage  this will naturally raise the questions and criteria of what to talk with your husband about and what to ask of himthink over whether you wish to divorce or notsince he has not taken any action then for the moment you can assume he is not sure of what he wantsonce you feel a little more clear on your opinion about your marriage including feeling uncertain if you would like it to end or continue then you will be able to tell your husband the suggestions you have for resolving the dispute matter and emotionstry to redirect your speculations about what does he want i wonder what he is thinking back to answering these very reasonable questions about yourselfthis will strengthen your own purpose in clarifying where to start and guide a discussion with himgood luck
551,i’ve suffered from insomnia and nightmares for about 3 years,"you’re noticing that as you lie down to go to sleep there
is quite a bit going on which may be anxiety related it sounds like the
dreams and difficulty sleeping are reminiscent of previous experiences you had
around the time of your break up the difficulty with your father’s business
and your mother’s health issues these connections to past events may be
important insights to continue exploring in addition to finding out more about
what your dreams may be trying to tell you there is no exact science to
dreams but many people find it fruitful to explore the content as it relates to
significant themes in their lives i think that exploring these issues further with
a therapist could help you resolve whatever is causing you the stress trouble sleeping and frightening dreams"
552,keeping secrets from my family,it sounds like keeping the secrets has become a problem for you now there are several things to consider before you make a decision you mentioned that you do not want your wife and mom to know because you do not want to hurt them – why would it hurt them  is it necessary for them to know this information what are the consequences of either telling them the truth or not telling them  once you have considered these think of what you would tell your friend if they were in your exact situation also if your wife or mom were in your situation right now what do you think they would do themselves if your wife and mom were in this situation how would you feel would you want to know the secrets how has keeping these secrets affected your own mental and physical healthonce you have looked at the problem from all angles you will be able to better make a decision on whether it is right to tell them or not
553,me and my girlfriend of 7 years are looking for some free couples counseling in modesto ca,hello i do not live in the california area however perhaps i could make some suggestions as to where you might look for free counseling first i must mention that most insurances now cover for many different types of issues including family issues if your girlfriend lives with you most insurances now cover livein partners as well if you have insurance contact your policy provider and ask whether or not couples counseling is includedaside from insurance the next place that comes to mind is a religious affiliation do you belong to a church or other religious organization many of the pastors or leaders in these disciplines have significant training in counseling as well as assisting with marriage and couples counseling these services are ordinarily offered free of charge to membersanother option might be to explore support groups within the area there may be a group in the form of a couples support group that brings couples together to explore their relationships in the safety of the group if you find there are no such groups in your area there are anonymous support groups online here is one such site httprelationshipsupportgroupscom
554,might i have depression,what happens in your life on wednesdays that you feel like crying   crying is natural  crying on wednesdays may also be natural if some type of regular event or situation comes up for you then that you do not like feel oppressed by and have no way of avoidingmaybe you would qualify for a diagnosis for depressionthis matters less than what you will do with a diagnosis  very often people feel some type of relief from hearing a professional tell them what they havedo not let yourself get talked into taking pills because now you have something  pills change your moodonly you can change your lifethe diagnosis matters so the therapist gets paid from insuranceit is a good sign that you know whether you feel true emotions or fake ones  this is a clear sign of knowing about yourselfyour mind feeling like a maze is a little too vague to know if you mean there are too many thoughts at once so that you have difficulty knowing which ones to examine first or if maze means you do not know what your thoughts are and  feel lost for this reasondepression which is addressed by a person can become quite liberating because you will remove what bothers you so much in your life that it weighs you down and depresses you
555,my apartment manager will not let me keep an emotional support dog,this can be a difficult situation  typically only animals that are specifically trains to accomplish a specific task are legally protected as service animsls even though that can be very helpful emotional support animals are not generally protected in the same wayyou might not be able to make your landlord accommodate you if possible you may want to consider a different apparent that is more animal friendly
556,my best friend says she loves me but is talking to a random guy,congrats on having your daughterhave you told your partner about your feelings of hurt and confusedthis is one possible way of opening a conversation about the different ways you each feel about one another and whether either of you would like changing or continuing to live together in light of the change in emotional connectionthe first step of having a dialogue about a relationship is being clear on what you are feeling what you are willing to contribute to the relationship and what you would like having in return from your partnerask your partner if she is willing to have a conversation on these topics  then allow some time so each of you is clear about their own expectations and what is possible to offer the otherthis is a fairly complex process and very often is difficult to keep on track without outside help to keep the discussion focusedit is normal for emotions to override our logic when discussing matters we care about deeplyif the conversations do not go very far or if your partner has no interest in talking stick with your own interest to more fully understand mattersinterview some therapists to find one whom you feel helps you clarify and find direction for yourself about this situation
557,my boyfriend does not do some sexual things with me that he has done with other people,first off do not blame yourself or be too quick to jump to any scary conclusions  human sexuality can be incredibly complex at times  there could actually be a number of things going on including him having performance anxietymaybe he had a bad experience with a previous partner that is left him scared to try again   it could also be that he puts you in a different category than previous lovers  sometimes i refer to this as the hookerhousewife mentality where a partner somehow gets the idea that when we truly fall in love we treat that one differently almost up on a pedestal  drives many partners crazy until they are aware that this is going on and give their boyfriend girlfriend permission to enjoy both the naughty and the nice with them it could also be that he is not even aware that he is not doing these things if you have not asked him yet you might try gently approaching the subject when you are not already in the bedroom or trying to get in on and inquire what he most enjoys about sex with you   you can also share your favorite highlights of sex with him  give him an ego boost and tell him what he does well while then asking him if he would be down to go downtown  baby it really turns me on when you kiss me during sexif you continue to get the impression that it is somehow only about you or that he is just really hesitant to talk about sex in general you might see if he would be cool to chat with a counselor who specializes in sexual intimacy
558,my boyfriend does not compromise with me,there’s a difference between what you want what you need and what you have being able to assertively identify express your wants and needs to your boyfriend may be helpful in times of negotiation often couples focus on recounting all the negative traits and issues when is time to negotiate and that impairs the ability to explore and find solutions objectivelyyou could use couples mediation to learn assertive communication skills and filter the information needed to resolve or negotiate a solution mi novio no transa conmigoúltimamente mi novio y yo hemos tenido muchos desacuerdos todo se debe al hecho de que queremos cosas diferentes  yo hago mucho por él lo cuido y protejo y al final el no confía en mí  ambos hemos llegado a la conclusión que cuando yo quiero algo que él no quiere él no está dispuesto a encontrar el punto medio  no es negociable  no estoy segura de que hacer el no confía en mi tanto como quisiera que lo hiciera a veces siento su enemiga y eso me mata hay una gran diferencia entre lo que quieres lo que necesitas y lo que tienes  poder identificar y expresar asertivamente lo que quieres y necesitas en tu relación te ayudara en los momentos de negociación   muchas veces las parejas se enfocan en recontar todos los problemas y características negativas a la hora de negociar y eso les impide hablar claramente del problema presente e identificar soluciones específicaspueden usar la mediación de parejas para aprender técnicas de comunicación asertiva y tener asistencia filtrando e identificando la información que les ayudara a resolved o negociar una solución al problema
559,my boyfriend feels that i have taken advantage of him,a key factor in a relationship is trusti would start by understanding more about why you feel unable to trust your bfdoes this have something to do with a bad encounter you had from previous relationships or with a sibling or parentits also possible you are intuitively sensing you cannot trust your bf bc he is not trustworthy  sometimes people sense the basic safety items in a relationship before they emergealso your bf may have similarly suffered broken trust and he gives off a feeling of not welcoming your trustits possible you are feeling his own selfprotection about being in a relationship with youthe best way to open these topics is to actually talk about them together with himwhatever the underlying tensions are talking about them always adds positive feeling and confidence to a relationship
560,my boyfriend is always accusing me of not loving him,hi savannah this is a pretty common issue one person feels that they are doing a great job of being loving yet their partner does not feel loved there's a great book the five love languages by gary chapman he explains that there are five main ways to give and receive love but we do not necessarily all speak the same love language as our partner you might feel that by going out to work and earn money you are being loving but if your partner's main love language is quality time you are not hitting that bulls eye because you are not home the five languages are words quality time acts of service gifts and touch i recommend couples grab this book sit down and figure out what their love languages are and thenslowlyyou start to ask for the kind of love you want and you start to speak your partner's language a bit better you may never be fluent but you can get better the most important part is to understand each other better and to know that there's nothing wrong with either of you you are just speaking different languages you can help your boyfriend to get really specific about how he wants to be loved i bet he just needs you to speak his language  
561,my boyfriend is upset about my friendship with another guy,it is not the case of being right or wrong in my view if you are asking i believe you truly care for your boyfriend it seems like he is having difficulties in establishing trust in this relationship the ideal would be to come closer to his upsetness and to show him that you are there for him i hope all goes well rossana mag
562,my boyfriend is not sexually performing like he did before i found out he was cheating,orbetter yet is it you still thinking about the other girl  i am sure his cheating hurt you emotionally and may have affected your sexual performance as well  make sure the other girl is out the picture on your end as well  sounds like something the both of you need to have a calm and adult conversation about
563,my boyfriend of a little over a year has a problem with me going to visit my mother,your boyfriend and you have a separate relationship than your relationship with your mother   by trying to control whether or not you visit your mom unless you are in agreement with this is building tension between you and himask why he resents your interest to see your motherif he is insecure to the point where he fears your mother will influence your opinion about him then trying to prevent you from visiting your mom is itself creating negativity in you toward himif something still bothers him about the problems you both had several months ago then talking about these problems will do more to clear the air between the two of you than him trying to interfere in your relationship with your mother
564,my boyfriend says he does not like to do things with me because we fight too much,congrats on the birth of your sonyour situation sounds painful lonely and isolatingand these features are eating away at your selfconfidencestart by believing in yourself  the feelings and ideas you describe here would only be arising from within you because they are at the very least partly trueask your boyfriend if he is willing to listen and understand your point of view  if he does then hopefully the two of you will more easily talk with one another about the truth of feeling overwhelmed by the quick pace of your courtship and becoming a familyif these discussions continuously include him blaming you for having your own feelings and expecting him to more actively be a part of your and your songs life then you will need to start valuing your feelings and what is best for you and your son by yourselfi send you lots of good luck
565,my boyfriend says he needs time to think about us,this seems like two questions  the first is what may have happened to prompt him to back off  the second is what it means to you to have a boyfriend who takes antidepression medication who says he has a lot on his mind  both give you opportunity to look at yourself  having expectations can be a huge trap  i write about this extensively in the first chapter of my book living yes   is there any way that you can enjoy your time together without expecting anything down the road  are there wonderful lessons for you to take from the relationship  even if it only lasts three weeks  can you create a mindset of gratitude for what is and let the future expectations go  are there new ways to communicate that might bring you together  what are the lessons for you about allowing the relationship to develop its own course on its own time  again let go of all expectations and see what happens that is what living yes requiresi am sure this will work out well for you  either with him or without him  mark  
566,my boyfriend thinks he is perfect and puts his friends before me,hi ontario i live in the other ontario in canada i will try to help you sort this out you have a long list of complaints about your boyfriend it sounds like he is maybe a bit immature and moody and these things affect you for sure i get it it is got me curious and if i was working with you i would want to know a lot more about how long you have been together and what's actually working well between you two i would also ask a lot of questions about the details of your description what tells you he is 'sneaky' does he lie how do you know he lies to you also are you wanting to make things better with him do you just want an ear to vent to are you looking for validation or do you hope someone will help you wake up to an unhappy situation  it helps me if i know what you wantwhenever i meet someone who has a lot of complaints about their partner or boyfriend i encourage them first to look at the language they are using some of your words tell me that you think you know what he is thinking  it is always tricky when we assume what someone's thinking and in an argument or dialogue these kinds of statements tend to lead to defensiveness and an escalated argument i would encourage you to focus on his actual behaviours and how they affect you rather than the motives or beliefs you think are behind the behaviours  as a general rule the when you do x i feel y sentence goes far in helping others understand what we feelso it is fair to say when you lie to me i cannot trust you or when you end our date early to hang with your friends i feel like i am not important to you or your mood swings are difficult for me or i do not seem to get apologies from you try to focus on his actual behaviour when you talk to him about this stuff a relationship counsellor can help you each understand the other better beyond the surface behaviours if you want to improve the relationshipthat said i have to askif you have not been with mr not so great for very long is it maybe time to rethink the relationship unless there is a balance of really loving and positive behaviours that you are leaving out you do not seem happy a good therapist can help you understand why you are stuck in an unhappy relationship if that is what's happening there's a lot to sort out herehow to communicate about your needs how to know when to call it quits if something does not feel good i wish you the best as you continue to examine these questions with assistance from friends or professionals
567,my boyfriend wants me to sign a contract of things not to do,hi dallas while i think it is healthy for both members of a couple to have things that they need from each other and to talk about that your situation sounds onesided and rigid will you have a list too there are elements of control here humiliating you in front of coworkers saying you have to sign the contract before you can move forwarddoes he decide when you move in and out your passive aggressive communications with the other man and your difficulty in knowing what direction you want also hint that maybe you do not have a voice in this relationship do you have a voice if you are uncomfortable with the contract are you listening to your own voice if you cannot hear your own voice maybe it is time to sit down with a therapist and strengthen yourself so you can at least know what you feel and wantno relationship is all good or all bad relationships do not come with billboards that tell us what to do they do not come with crystal balls that tell us what will happen  you have everything you need in order to make the best decision for you right now except clarity and his control may be what is making things muddy for you you are too busy blaming yourself to see the situation clearly a therapist can help you stop blaming yourself and see what your situation is
568,my boyfriend wants nothing to do with me after his dad's suicide,i am sorry to learn of this  you must be extremely frustrated and heartbroken  to begin he is correct  you have done nothing wrong  this is entirely a coping mechanism in overdrive  it is fear  it is anger  it is extreme sadness  it is feelings of abandonment  it is intense emotional pain  it is his way of protecting himself from potential unexpected additional lossi am not familiar with how old this post is but often it will require time and understanding  if he speaks with you encourage him to get grief counseling  do not encourage it for your relationship encourage it for his betterment coping with losing his dad  start there  good luck
569,my boyfriend wants to know every details of my sex life,not in my book you are only two months in at this early stage this is a bit of a warning sign if he cannot accept or feel comfortable with who you are and decisions you have made there's already a level of discomfort here that should not be ignored no he does not have the right to penalize you or punish you not just for past thingsnot for anything what he does get to do it tell you how it affects him sureif he feels uncomfortable or needs reassurancelisten to those things but if he does not dig who you are maybe he can walk the other way
570,my boyfriend's family expects him to take them on dates and he does not think anything's wrong,well then you learned something new about your boyfriendare you fine with having a different opinion than him and staying togetherthink over how major a problem this is to you and if it is reason enough to leave the relationshipthere are always plenty of areas of disagreement between partners in a relationshipthe key to being happy is to know which ones you can accept and which ones are beyond your tolerance with which to livealso an early step would be to directly tell your boyfriend your opinion   he may be willing to change his ways to satisfy you
571,my brother is an addict he has does nothing but ruin my family i do not know how to cope with it anymore,i think the best thing for you is to speak with someone on how you can best cope with the situation  it can be challenging living in a household with someone who is currently addicted  it is also important that you realize that you can only work on yourself  other individuals need to take the same accountability  enabling often happens in households with addiction it can be a challenging environment to live in
572,my brother never hangs out with me anymore,hi zionsville it is so sweet that you have a special relationship with your brother you will always have that you know he is doing what's natural at his agespreading his wings and looking for love you may be heading into that zone soon too but i get that it is weird that he is there before you and you miss himtry to respect your brother's autonomy wish him well be friendly with his girlfriend and it is also okay to say hey bro i am still here when can we hang out
573,my brother's exgirlfriend does not want her son to see us anymore,hi tampa i get that this is a loss for all of you you have bonded with this child as a result of the significant time you have spent with him he is a lucky boy to have had you all taking care of him certainly it seems that his mother might not be making the best decision for her son if you are willing to maintain the relationship it would be good for him to still have that contact in my book the more people loving a child the better but ultimately she has the right to make these decisions to oppose her will not likely do any good you can focus on grieving this relationship and supporting your brother through his loss as well
574,my child urinated in his mother's drink,well it is certainly unusual and potentially could be cause for alarm it is a passive aggressive act if done intentionally so i would wonder if this child is trying to say somethingi think without any context however or sense of whether there are other signs of disturbance it is impossible to say what's going on if there are other signs of distress or very unusual behaviours you might bring the child to someone who can assess him properly
575,my companion tells me he wants nothing to do with me,your partners obviously very confused when it comes to love sometimes people shy away from good and positive relationships and companionship because their afraid they know that it is something worth holding on to but most feel they cannot handle it and cannot meet up to their partners expectations your partner loves you but must have fear that keeps standing in his way it could also mean their afraid of getting hurt or disapointed in the long run  give your partner comfort and reassurance that they can come to you to confide in you about anything that may be bothering them
576,my dad is mad because i identify as a male and i was born a female,maybe this is emotional abuseit certainly is irritating and annoying to be yelled at for being yourselfmaybe at a time when he is not yelling you can bring up the topic of your own willingness if this is true to discuss questions he has about your genderthere's no guarantee he will not start yelling midway through a dialogue like this  only then you will be on firm ground to excuse yourself from the conversation since you already explained that you are willing to talk with him and not to be yelled at by him
577,my daughter calls me crazy and i’m not sure how to handle that,hi arkansas your situation sounds like a case of parental alienation your expartner unfortunately has the power to say things to your children that poison their relationship with you it is a form of woman abuse and child abuse he is likely doing this to hurt you and have power over you and he is not considering how it is affecting the kids i have seen this happen in many families parents who once had a strong loving relationship with their children suddenly feel abandoned in favor of the other parent in some cases children actually stop having contact with one parent who is left bewildered and powerless it is your ex's job to support your relationship with your kids not try to destroy it while you cannot change his behaviours and i think you know that there are things you can do for yourself and your kids for your children you can refuse to enter into the war he is setting up he is trying to provoke you into acting crazy but you do not have to fall for this if you run around screaming he is lying it only makes you look more 'crazy' try to stay calm and do not put their dad down to them no matter how tempting it is one day they may be ready to hear the truth of your relationship with their father but wait until they ask trust that they have their own experience of their dad and trust that he does not have the power to destroy their love for you children in the long term lose respect for parents who denigrate the other parent they see who their dad is already i would bet but they do not know how to cope with that if he is the only one fighting a war you are helping them feel less trapped in a parental conflict do not engage on his level do not blame your children completely although i have to say that for them to call you names like crazy is not acceptable and you do not need to tolerate that disrespect try to deal with this behaviour without bringing their dad into it they are acting out their father's agenda likely because they instinctively see his weakness children often support the weaker parent rather than abandon them you get the worst because they trust your love but you can still have boundaries letting them abuse you is not the answer but have compassion for their position this picture is not their fault but as adults they can be held accountable for their choicesreassure yourself that you are the mom you know you are you do not need them to gush all over you in order to know that you made sacrifices hold onto the likelihood that some day they will come back and be grateful it may take a while you cannot rush it but they will see you for who you are your power is in giving them a consistently calm generous connected supportive mom who refuses to play games or be walked on i would recommend trying to connect with other parents who experience this phenomenon or a therapist who can reinforce these goals and help keep you grounded good luck
578,my daughter is in her 30s not married and pregnant how can i break the news to the family,hi new york there is no need for shame here no one's done anything wrong a pregnancy is a glorious gift to be celebrated i wonder what gets in the way of you celebrating your daughter's pregnancy are they excited about it i bet they are they have been together for seven years even if it caught them off guard the best thing for them and this new baby is to celebrate the joy of this new little person and their growing family if you are happy for them and help spread their joy how marvelous would that be for them as a familynew york i will be honest with you i hope that is okay i sense that maybe you are feeling judgemental towards them do you dislike or judge his struggle with mental illness do you see him as less than worthy because he has not worked i do not know for sure but i imagine maybe his anxiety and depression get in the way of working maybe he is on a social disability mental illness does not make someone less lovable or valuable as a partner he is getting help for himself and that is wonderful if your daughter loves him and is happy with him if he is her chosen man then they absolutely need your support not your judgement and if they struggle as a couple you know whatthey will need it even moreis this your first grandchild if not then i do not have to say this but if it isyou are in for the most amazing adventure of your lifetime you will fall in love so deeply with this child she needs thatthis baby needs your love and supportso you say to your family i have amazing news my daughter is expecting a baby i am going to be a grandparent i cannot wait
579,my daughter is not acting her age,this is certainly an important issue to look into it is always helpful to speak with the child's pediatrician since they are most familiar with the child's developmental history also children tend to regress behaviorally when facing events and interactions they feel to have no control over this can be as simple as a loss of a pet a recent move death in the family  andor as serious as sexual abuse and other things if you have not spoken to the school that can be a good starting point
580,my daughter will not stop stealing and lying,i would be curious about there potentially being some emotional or physical trauma in your daughter's history that she is struggling with physical trauma is usually easier to identify but emotional trauma can be feeling a lack of emotional connection in her important relationships having experienced bullying or some other emotional injury the fact that there are some defiance symptoms going on suggests that she might be in need of a safe place to process what she is going through and the potential issue with control or meeting emotional needs with food is also concerning i would recommend looking for a therapistcounselor who works with childrenadolescents in the area of addressing trauma for an assessment they may be able to ask the right questions to see whether trauma is truly the issue
581,my daughterinlaw is smoking marijuana while pregnant,have you reached your own conclusions and reasons for these regarding the topic   when you feel confident in your own reasons for your conclusions then obviously ask your daughter in law for some time together and tell her what you think and your reasons for opinionsplan for this meeting according to the type of relationship you have with your daughter in lawsince your son will also be affected by the prenatal conditions of his child he may also be interested in being part of this conversationalso during your discussion find out the exact ways the morning sickness affects your daughter in lawit is possible that scheduling adjustments in routines can be made so your daughter has more time to rest or fewer responsibilities for a while until she feels bettermaybe you and other family members can lighten her daily routines so she has more time for herself to manage her morning sickness in a less risky waysending good luck
582,my ex left without fully explaining but i feel broken and empty,since you realize your sense of trust was broken withdrawing from close relationships makes sensethis may be your self giving you natural time to recuperate from emotional painalso it is your chance to think over how to handle yourself differently in future relationshipsmaybe this process requires more time than you would likehaving patience is very difficult when a person feels hurta therapist of your own may be a good idea so you have someone for guidance and to chart your progress w youthis may feel less lonely and help you tolerate the waiting period till you are better
583,my exboyfriend and i broke up about 3 months ago and now he wants me back,finding the right person is a tricky thing to do why did you and your ex break up 3 months ago in relationships with others you get to see a reflection of yourself sometimes you may enjoy that reflection other times it may not feel so good i am not sure where you are in your life and relationships and what you do from here depends on what you desire more of in your life but i am not simply talking in the moment desire i am referring to the direction you want your life to go if one of these guys was to support youwho would help you reach your dreams and who would you enjoy spending time with it is complicated and no one can answer the 'what to do' question but you slow down tune into your heart listen
584,my exboyfriend is with someone new and it hurts,i am very sorry for the pain you are suffering losing the most significant person in your life is extremely painful and breakups are often equated to a death there will certainly be a grieving process that you go through and time passing will allow the hurt to subside with that being said seeing a therapist is highly recommended as it sounds like continuous support may be necessary for healing to take place anytime sadness causes thoughts of suicide or self harm it is important to get help immediately a therapist can help you by validating your feelings and what you are going through while also working with you to move through the grieving process adopt new hobbies social outlets and goals for your future while starting over and trying out new ways of being may seem like a daunting task it will only make things easier and give you a sense of hope and purpose for your future with the new year right around the corner this could be viewed as a good time and opportunity to get reaquainted with yourself and set goals related to living a more fullfilling life hang in there with a support system in place and a healthy mindset things can only get easier best of luck to you
585,my exboyfriend put himself on a dating website because he thought i was not interested,it sounds like there is a bit of confusion regarding how you two feel about each other do you know what type of relationship you want with him a friendship only casual dating or an exclusive relationship i would encourage you to first figure that out and then communicate to him how you are feeling ask him to be honest with you about how he feels and what he wants from your relationship as well be mentally prepared for a variety of responses from him so that there are no major surprises by clearing the air and learning what your own and each other's desires are you can then move forward with a plan without that clarification there will likely be false assumptions unanswered questions and confusion
586,my exboyfriend say we are finished but still acts like we are not,that does sound very confusingand hurtful  you do not have to tolerate someone treating you in a way that hurts you  it may be helpful to decide where the boundaries are for you and to stay true to them in your interactions with him  you teach other people how they are allowed to treat you
587,my exboyfriend would not let me have my daughter because i did not know my stepdaughter's pickup details,hi i appreciate your mature instincts and strong efforts to draw clear boundaries in this very complex situation i agree that it sounds like the adult drama is unnecessary and potentially will affect the children children need adults around them to act maturely cooperatively and peacefully even when they do not like each other it helps them feel secure and lets them focus on learning and growing your exboyfriend seems more focused on his own needs in fact he demonstrates behaviours that are aggressive controlling and manipulative bordering on 'parental alienationg i agree this is a problemi also appreciate how protective you are of yourself at this vulnerable time with the pregnancy it is not unusual for pregnancy to trigger a need to conserve energy and reduce stress honour this instinct you have i will suggest a few things to you first to gather support around you professionally if you need it from family and friends and certainly from your husband if you two are on the same page regarding the children issues and your ex that will help he can help run interference when it comes to his daughter it will help you feel supportedknow that your ex's behaviours are not happening because you did anything wrong it is the way he operates  you cannot change him but you can stop blaming yourself for his immaturity and aggression you are correct that he will always be there and you can both accept this fact and also find ways to manage the situationkeep on defining clear boundaries you might sound like a broken record  but that is okay it is okay to ignore his efforts to pull you into an argument or power struggle it is okay to not respond to texts or other communications that are not vitally important it is okay to not let him into your house if it makes you uncomfortable it is okay to not engage with him more than is necessaryregarding his manipulative behaviours that reflect a tendency to keep your daughter from you i recommend you document these behaviours and incidents carefully and fully let him know what your expectations are simply and clearly and in writing  your daughter does not have to be aware i think you already understand that she needs to be protected from the adult conflicta professional therapist can help you with all of this i hope this helps get you started towards greater peace at least within yourself 
588,my family cannot stand me,i am so very sorry for how pressured and sad you feel right nowdefinitely all family members have an effect on the other onesfrom what you write your family members are not considering the effect their negative comments have on youalso keep in mind that each person is responsible for deciding to argue or find a different way to discuss a problem you are not in control of the other people in your familymore likely they take the easy way out and blame you for what they do not want to know about themselvesstay aware that the family's decision to target you does not mean that you are doing something wrong   certainly your existence is not wrong which is the degree to which the unfairness seems to have spreadwhat to do about it is read about family systems to see more explanations on how you are being unfairly treatedalso stay in touch with friends bc these are the people who value and respect you
589,my family says i have depression,i am alway wary of assigning a term to a feeling as often that term becomes more important than the feeling itself from the very little that you have written it is clear that you are going through something that has made you extremely low affected your selfesteem and motivation limits your enjoyment of formerly pleasurable activities and affects your feelings of selfworth all of these are aspects of being depressed though you can be depressed and still not have depression counseling is definitely a place where you can go and sort out why you have had such a sudden a drastic change to your mood sometimes our mood can be effected by changes in our routine losses or significant disappointments talking with someone will not only help you to better understand why you are feeling this way but they will also help you to ground yourself and learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood and strategize for the future i do hope that you will reach out feeling alone can be harmful over long periods of time as it can stop us from seeking out the support we need
590,my father has always been horrible to me,hi louisiana you got it righthe is supposed to be your father it is tough enough being adopted  what you do not need is to be verbally abused by someone who's supposed to love and protect you i do not know how old you are  or where your mom is but i bet there are other people in your life who treat you differently it is your right to spend your time with the people who love you properly that is a really important part of learning how to be happycarefully choosing who's going to be in your life it is tricky to put emotional distance between you and your supposedtobe father but it is possiblephysical distance  and emotional distance  i think you are already doing that part because you do not blame yourself for his words which is wonderful i do not know if he is evil  but he may be incapable of loving properly or lacking empathy as you suggest a good therapist can support you in these goals i wish you the best in your growth as an independent adult 
591,my fiancé cheated how can we mend our relationship,what makes love last how to build trust and avoid betrayal by john gottman is a great book for you both to start reading you may also want to invest some time and energy in couples therapy it sounds like there is a lack of trust in your relationship likely a hangover from your beginnings that would be helpful for you both to work through to truly be able to forgive and move forward
592,my fiancé is trying to hide that he is texting his exgirlfriend,oh chino i only have half the picture here so i will be cautious there's a chicken and an egg and i do not know which came first one thing i see clearly is that your fiance will always have to have communications with his ex because they have children can you accept that when suspicion and insecurity come along your job is to look at the big picture and the real picture is there any real evidence that he is cheating remember that texting his ex is not evidence alone if the communications are about the kids has he earned your trust if so then it is not fair to punish him for the betrayals of others he is not your ex reassure your heart that you are his priority if the larger evidence supports that at the same time you can let him know what your triggers are for example hiding his phone does not send you a good message right see this is the chicken and the eggis he hiding the phone because you have been overreacting when he gets a text  so let him know you will not blow up about him getting a text if he does not conceal or password his phone transparency helps build trust you have sensitivities and it helps you a lot if he is aware of them and willing to try not to do things that trigger fear let him know when you get scared and hopefully he will give you the openness and security you need in order to trust him and act as if you trust him  
593,my fiancé's exhusband shows up unannounced,the short answer to your question is no it is not okay for anyone to ever be doing this there's a lot of unanswered questions and other factors going on here that need attention nevertheless do not hesitate to seek out legal counsel andor call 911    ideally your fiancé would be able to speak directly to her exhusband and set reasonable boundaries that honor whatever legal agreements are in force resultant from the divorce and custody agreements the fact that she is afraid to say anything to him about his inappropriate behavior and that she has not been able to give you any reason for her fear suggests possible factors of past abusive behaviors entitlement andor codependence   i hope things work out well for all and i am confident a skilled therapist could help all navigate how best to set boundaries and experience greater healing
594,my friend had lied about every aspect of her life—what do i do,to be honest i think more information would be really important here because what you are asking could have a lot of different meanings consider making an appointment with a local therapist to discuss what you are going through
595,my friends accusing me of having problems,it sounds like your confused as to why your friends would be calling you a hypocrite when they act in the same manner correct communication is key to any relationship i would recommend speaking with your friends facetoface to address why they feel your behavior is concerning inperson contact is the best method of sorting out differences considering texts emails or any written response can be misconstrued be upfront with them and let them know that being accused of hypocrisy is hurtful and you feel it is unfounded if after speaking with them you feel that they have valid reasons for the way they are feeling maybe you can consider modifying your behavior accordingly especially if this friendship is valuable to you however make sure they are aware that there is a respectful way to address these issues and name calling is not one of them on the other hand if you feel that their reasons are indeed unfounded it may be best to distance yourself from the relationship not all friendships are healthy ones and it is important that you surround yourself with people who are an asset to your self esteem as opposed to those that hinder iti hope you are able to get this matter sorted best of luck
596,my friends do not put effort into our relationship,one thing i would ask is why are you still hanging with those  a relationship needs to be nurtured by both parties it is a dynamic fluctuation between two people i would ask you to question why you continue to remain together as friends i always believed that a relationship should emit positivity towards all parties involved if your in a relationship that is onesided it is inevitable that it will start to decompensate never travel with the circus never travel with fools everything in life should have some positive payout will things at times be negative of course they will but in order to keep something or someone in your life there should be more positivity than negativityhope this helps c
597,my girlfriend always brings up past events and talks negatively about them,have you tried to talk about the subjects of the past in the present at a time in which there is no heat between the two of yousince your gf would like to resolve situations from the past the best way to do so would be to talk about them  the more you try to avoid certain subjects the more likely they will come up between you at worse possible momentsif you can get ahead of the pattern of old topics coming up without your control then try scheduling a discussion about them  this by itself will show your gf you care about what she cares about and this may be one quality she would feel good about
598,my girlfriend broke up with me but i want her back what do i do,i am sorry to hear of these troubles i see a few issues here i wonder why you were both trying to get pregnant when the relationship seemed troubled some people think that they can fix a broken relationship by getting pregnant and all this does is bring up more problemsyou say you never treated her badly and i believe you people in a relationship can still be unhappy even when there is no abuse or mistreatment going on in fact giving too much of yourself to the relationship and not having a “self” outside of this relationship can be unhealthy it takes two whole healthy happy people who are that way when they are single to come together to make a whole healthy happy couple in a relationship expecting your partner to meet all your needs or to provide your happiness is not going to workthere are two books that i recommend you buy and read one is codependent no more the other is can my relationship be savedsometimes when you cling and try even harder to hold onto someone it makes you both miserable you cannot change her and cannot change her mind sometimes the best thing is to let go if it is meant to be you will end up back together again it seems like this is something that she needs to decide since she is the one that keeps doing the leaving i suggest backing off and letting her go maybe she needs time to clear her head and make up her mind if it is meant to be she will come back if not use this time to work on being a healthy happy you on your own
599,my girlfriend cannot stand it when i touch her,was your gf always this way with you or did her withdrawal develop suddenlyalso are there any other changes going on between the two of you in terms of feeling relaxed and at ease with each other enjoying each otherits possible her physical withdrawal due to her sensitive nature about who touches her and the meaning of touch reflects an underlying emotional hesitation about her feelings toward youthis can be either strong positive or negative feelingsshe may be fearful of becoming more intimately attached to you and withdrawsshe may be actually withdrawing and expresses herself through the amount of touch she wants from othersbest way forward as almost always in a relationship is to have a gentle conversation to open up the tension between the two of you
600,my girlfriend is always accusing me of cheating on her when i have not,we women really do tend to struggle with the comparison game and hollywood culture has not helped with romantic comedies and song lyrics telling us that when a man appears evasive there's something to worry about it is been my clinical experience though that most women value transparency and security in their relationships so you might try sharing a little bit more about your history with this woman for examplewhere did you meet herhow long were you friends before you decided to call it quits why do not you want to be friends with her  i promise this tends to matter to womenwere you ever intimately involved with or even attracted to herif your girlfriend can truly see that you view her as the filet mignon to the other womangs hamburger and that she is your favorite person on the planet and has nothing to worry about she may start to come aroundnow if she is more concerned that you might be taking this womangs calls behind your back while i am not typically a huge fan of sharing passwords or phone records you might print them off and highlight this female's number and show your girlfriend that you absolutely are telling the truthand if you really want to step it up i would be intentional about doing all the little things that you know your girlfriend loves that helped make her fall in love with you in the first place   bottom line  show your girlfriend why out of all the women on the planet that you could be with you chose her  and would continue to do so all over again  and why you love her as a person  this will help her trust what you are saying best of luck to you  tamara powell lmhc
601,my husband and i are separated i am so scared of getting divorced,major change frightens almost everybodydo not be so afraid of your fear that you let yourself beg and are willing to accept unhappiness as a standard in your marriageif you start considering that life can be better than what is current for you now new possibilities and ideas will start developing in your mindconsider finding a therapist so that you have private space to talk in detail about your fears and the new ways of seeing your selfa therapy relationship since it is safe and supportive will be a good balance to having been abused suffered and unhappy
602,my husband and i can’t talk to each other without arguing,hi newark it sounds to me like your husband is going through something and i think you understand that you might feel very helpless sad and disrespected at the same time he is changed it is unfair for him to blame you for his emotions his mood issues are about him not you and he is either not recognising that or not taking responsibility for it are you respecting yourself here by drawing appropriate boundaries you can let him know when you feel disrespected and what's not okay with youhe may be experiencing depression which often shows up as irritability in men it could be that he is not telling you something or he is unaware of his emotional processes you can try a i am really worried about you you do not seem happy and i do not know how to help you some things are happening that are not okay with me will you see a therapist approach perhaps you could go with him the first time  it is about a combination of compassion selfrespect and seeking professional help i believe i wish you well
603,my husband cheated before marriage—what can i do,this sounds very painful for youare you able to tell him how his flirting affects youmaybe he does not care enough to change and maybe he doeslong term if he continues this then usually people feel they have two choices put up with it which of course greatly reduces the sense of satisfaction in the relationship   or of course you can decide to end the relationship  this choice is quite significant now that you have a child together  give yourself plenty of time to think over the best outcome
604,my husband does not include me in the family,hi floridai get the sense that aside from this relationship you are quite isolated in general it is sad that you are feeling excluded at christmastime and family events while i would suggest that you do not really know what he or his family are thinking or feeling  he is certainly behaving in a very distant excluding manner and it is understandable that you would feel rejected and hurt how long has this part been happening has he always acted this way or is it more recent did something happen recently you mentioned doing stupid things to yourself and i do not know what that means if you are engaging in selfharm he may be confused about what to do and he might need some time to think and be separate but is having trouble talking about this part of the problem of course is that you do not know what's going on for him certainly you deserve the truth and if he does not want to spend time with you i would hope he would be honest have you been open to hearing the truth from him is there any reason for him to hesitate to tell you why he is being distant maybe you could ask him if you are ready to heari am glad to hear that you believe that you deserve a full loving relationship although it seems that moving forward might be difficult for you is it possible your happiness is a bit too dependant on this man i am just guessing based on what you have said here  it seems that it is possible your situation has led to some depression and i would recommend a session with a qualified therapist to help you sort this out you will need support even if the relationship is repaired best of luck
605,my husband does not trust me,i am sorry to hear about the trust issues in your relationship trust as you clearly know is essential to healthy relationships past indiscretions or dishonesty can damage this trust and make it really hard to confidence that these things will not happen again despite reassurances we tend to be very sensitive to betrayal and risks to our relationship security rebuilding trust takes time and effort for both parties on your end you may need to provide more reassurance and more concrete evidence that you are trustworthy gestures of transparency  and more patience and empathy for his fears on his end he may need to learn to be with his insecurities and fears and ask for reassurance about your love and commitment in ways that do not lead to criticizing you attempting to control you or limiting your freedom if you are not able to come to agreements about how to put his fears to rest without it negatively impacting your life i would suggest getting some professional help from a marriage counsellor or couples therapist
606,my husband is harsh towards our son and threatened me,i have had these many cases but in situations like this if it does get out of hand the police do need to be involved sit down and talk to your husband when he is calm and collective
607,my husband kept a huge secret from me,trust is a necessary factor for an intimate relationship to feel safethe person who must repair the trust is the one who has broken this trustthe best way to find out if your husband wants to restore your trust in him is to ask him this question  he may not be willing to meet your requestif he hesitates or becomes defensive about the need to restore your trust then ask him to think his decision through and tell him the serious consequence you are consideringask him to reflect for a few days or a week and then to address the topic againif you and he consistently find that he is unwilling to do anything at all to regain your trust then i agree you have serious thinking to do as to whether or not you would be able to live within a partnership based upon trust in which you do not trust your partner
608,my husband makes me uncomfortable about sex,hello and thank you for your question first i want to tell you how sorry i am for the experience you had with your parents that is a grief and trauma that is certainly hard to imagine trauma and grief can affect us in many ways and certainly deeply personal things like our sex lives it may be difficult for others to make the connection but it is there so for example if stress and trauma make you feel like you are not interested in sex a partner may take it as a personal rejection rather than response to stress trauma or grief if your husband will agree to it couple's counseling may be your best bet a counselor can help you with your communication and may be able to provide some education to your husband about trauma and how it can have an impact on intimacy if he does not agree to go it may be worth it to go on your own you still have a lot you are dealing with yourself and sometimes our personally therapy can influence others so it may be a good idea it is important to remember that even though you are married you have the right to make decisions about your body and that includes when you want to have sex with it i hope this is helpful and some of my colleagues may have ideas also be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc
609,my husband only has sex with me once a month or less,feeling rejected and frustrated is a reasonable reaction to your experience with your husband i want to encourage you that his actions may have little to do with you and regardless of outcomes i hope you find the help you need to process through your pain and still have hope for your marriage   if your husband was to work with me i would explore with him his understanding of and experience with intimacy in relationship with others furthermore like other male clients of mine i would challenge your husband to secure an updated full medical exam from his pcp andor urologist in order to identify or rule out any organic issues which may be causing his apparent lack of desire for sexual intimacy if there are no physical issues per se i would encourage your husband to process further his family of origin storyline regarding rules roles sex and sexuality along with working through his sexual and trauma histories
610,my husband said he loves me but is not in love with me,i get it your husband tells you that he is not in love with you but oops he is changed his mind and will tolerate you for a while longer excuse me my dear it is okay if you expect more than that from a marriage maybe the question has shifted from whether he is happy in the marriage to whether you are happy in the marriage you say you love this man  who makes you feel like nothing i say it might be time to sit down with an individual therapist and look objectively at your marriage and whether it is working for you
611,my husband seems to be changing and i feel angry and hurt,it seems that you have been very disconnected from each other which naturally  could contribute to symptoms of saddness and even depression obviously something has shifted which you do not understand therefore  perhaps you should consider attending couples therapy to help work through your concerns and feelings  it would also be beneficial to assess if in fact any depression or other underlying issue is going on communication is so important in any relationship and the manner in which we express ourselves to our partner can either invite curiosity and emotional connection or shut down connection imago dialoguing is a helpful tool for couples for communication as it teaches  validating and empathic listening to better heal disconnection
612,my husband seems to end his relationships with women whenever he has an infant,this sounds really difficult and i can understand your motivation to get to bottom of why this behaviour has occurred  especially if your husband continues to have a relationship with you and your children with that being said  relationships and mental health are very complicated and you are unlikely to find the answers you are looking for in order for someone to be diagnosed with a mental illness or in order for them to identify what leads them to fall into particular patterns in relationship  they would need to be willing to seek help and honestly talk about their challenges something that you say your ex is not willing to do  while it might be a relief to understand what is going on with him  it might be more comforting for you to get support for yourself in processing your feelings and everything that has come up for you as a result of his choices
613,my husband treats me terribly,hi texas thanks for your honesty it helps me know where to go in answering you what strikes me in your question is that you describe several ways in which your husband is hurtfulabusivecontrolling with you and then you ask should we call it quits we i wonder if maybe the first step is for you to start seeing this decision as yours rather than yours together the way your husband treats you is not your fault texas your lies are a natural and normal way of you avoiding situations and encounters that feel unsafe for you the problem is not your lying the problem is that you do not feel safe enough to be honest with a person you are supposed to be able to trustthere's an analogy that i sometimes use i do not know if this is scientifically true or simply a useful story but it is powerful either way so i will tell it to youif you take a frog and drop it into a pot of boiling water the frog will jump out immediately knowing instinctively that if it stays in the pot it will die if you take a frog however and put it in a pot of cold water and slowly slowly heat it to boiling the frog will boil to death because it will fail to recognise the moment when it no longer has the energy to jump out of the pot by the time it realises it is dying it has lost its strength it is called learned helplessness when your power or your voice has been taken away for a long time you get used to that and you fail to see the options that are available to you you have a toddler and you may be under the impression that staying in the marriage is best for the child in my experience and what research backs up is that children first and foremost need a safe environment and parents who are happy you are likely underestimating the effects on your child of living in a home with woman abuse this is a complex picture and if you were my client i would want to get you to a stronger place emotionally where you are seeing the situation clearly and gathering resources and supports before you make any big decisions but i do see that there are decisions that are there for you to make that can lead to a happy life for you and your child i sincerely hope you seek professional help with either a shelter for abused women or a therapist i wish you the best
614,my husband wants a divorce after i was diagnosed with severe depression,wow that is tough there is nothing worse than fearing abandonment when you are already struggling with depression it sounds like you are still wanting to work through whatever challenges you and your husband are having but your husband may not be on the same page i would encourage you and your husband to seek professional support if you have not already while depression can put real strains on a relationship relationship problems can lead to or contribute to depression and there may be some real benefits to both of you in doing some couple therapy with that being said  if your husband is not willing to do therapy or is clear that he wants the relationship to end then i cannot see what choice you have but to respect his decision as you mentioned this does not mean that you have to feel okay with the decision  as i am sure you would not  but ultimately loving one another and staying in committed relationships is a choice that we each have to make if he is wanting to leave  this could make things a lot tougher for you i would encourage you to seek professional support for yourself and reach out to lots of friends and family you do not need to face depression alone  nor should you have to we all need support at tough times like these
615,my husband was lying about drinking again,as exasperated as you feel and as obvious it is to you that your husband cares more about drinking than being honest with you changing this is up to himdoes he care that you are upset with him for drinking more than he can handledoes he care about you more than drinkingliving with an alcoholic which is how his behavior sounds is lonely and frustratingconcentrate on what you like about him as he is now with his drinkingyour happiness matters  his ignoring of what you are talking about does not mean your requests are unreasonablebe prepared to learn to live with and accept how he behaves or notavoid the expectation that you can convince him to changepeople change only when they realize their life can improve by changing  he does not sound like this at least now
616,my husband works all the time and neglects his family,i am glad you are aware to expect more satisfaction from being part of a couple than you currently describe yourself as havingare you and your husband able to talk about any or all of what you have written herehis answers would be a starting point for knowing how he understands his share of your relationship and whether and how he would like making any changesif the two of you feel too much tension in the relationship to bring up any of the topics you write about here then ask yourself the reason for thisvery commonly people are afraid to ask questions of their partner even when feeling unhappy and that they would like changes to the relationshipoften people are fearful of harsh criticism by the partner and worry that by simply stating the reasons for feeling unhappy will mean hearing judgments against them spoken by the partnerit is always a good idea to utilize the services of a professional credentialed and licensed therapist if after trying to start a conversation on the topics you bring up here does not go well or very farfor all of us the emotions in our intimate relationships are deep and powerful  they are not easy to handle especially under tension and frustrationsending lots of good wishes for future happiness
617,my husband yells “enough” when i tell him he needs to change,i empathize with your feeling crazy hearing your husband yell enough in response to you wanting to make a point to himwhen the immediate situation has calmed down  have you ever told him that this upsets you  is it possible he simply is not aware that you feel upset by how he talks to youkeep in mind too that what you believe your husband must change may not agree with his opinion on what he needs to changea helpful starting place for the two of you to discuss once the immediate situation has calmed down is what you each feel would have been a reasonable way of handling the situation that just happenedby learning more about how the other person thinks and feels it will be easier to know what to expect form each othereven if you disagree about what is best knowing that there are differences between you may make living with them easier to accept or at least not be surprised and startled by themsending good luck to both of you
618,my longdistance boyfriend has started to pull away from me—what can i do,have you asked your boyfriend directly this questionit is a good question and possibly would open a necessary clarifying discussion as to what each of you expects from the other
619,my mentallyill motherinlaw wants to babysit,hi fontanathanks for providing all the details needed in order to respond to your question it seems very clear to me that no would be the appropriate response i like your healthy boundaries and i will help you explore possible ways to respond to her first she has not asked yet and you do not know that she will right now you can pleasantly ignore her hints they are not hurting you and if you ignore them they are more likely to go away you can address and reduce your own anxiety about the possibility of her asking by reassuring yourself that you have the right as parents to make this decision and that if she is offended that does not mean that you are being mean it means that she has unrealistic expectations so the first goal is to put it out of your mind as a worry you might never have to face that moment but i understand that you want to be preparedas her son perhaps your husband is the best one to answer the question should it ever come is he willing to do this but if you are comfortable and if you are the one she asks you can confidently give her a simple honest response about why it will not happen and i would suggest presenting a firmly closed door rather than saying but maybe later no need to apologize or hum and hawwe love that you want to be around junior and we definitely want you in hisher life  you are not in a healthy place and we are not comfortable with you caring for himher on your ownif she pushes the issue this is evidence of her denial or inappropriate boundaries i would let her know that it is not negotiable that you understand if she is disappointed but you are not open to discussing the issue really there's nothing to discuss learning not to take responsibility for her emotions is part of having an ill person in your life i wish you the best
620,my mother is trying to control my life and i do not know what to do,hi   i am sorry you are having such a tough time with this situation  i have worked with a number of young adults in their 20's who have had to move back home after college  or even stay at home through the college years  bottom line is that either way  it is so difficult when you are trying to discover who you are and what you want your life to be  to have to live at home   i have even heard much older adults clients  say that when they visit their childhood home  they suddenly feel like a kid again   the old dynamics between adults and their parents and siblings can pop right up as if they have gone back in time and are no longer adults i would suggest that you approach your mom and say something like i am hoping we can talk about the best way for us to manage me living here  i really appreciate that you are giving me a place to live until i get on my feet  and i want to be respectful of you and our home  at the same time  though i feel like it is important for me to have more independence than when i was younger because i am growing up and trying to learn more about myself and become more autonomous can we talk about what might be fair rules that we can  both live with  if she is receptive  maybe you can each write a separate list of what you think would be fair and reasonable and then compare lists and try to make compromises and come up with a list of guidleines that feel fair to you both    if this is too hard to do alone  perhaps you and your mom can meet with a therapist a few times who can help you to come  up with some kind of compromise contract   this is not an easy situation  but if you can approach your mom in a calm and mature way and suggest a planned structured discussion that does not take place in the heat of the moment  your mom may be impressed by your maturity and even more receptive to working out some rules that you can both live withgood luck elissa gross
621,my new husband constantly talks to himself,some people simply talk to themselves as a way of processing information have you checked in with your husband about this in a nonaccusatory way something like hey babe  i am so curious what that is all about do you notice that you are talking out loud chances are it is just how he thinks things through and is not at all about trying to make you crazy it is just one of his quirks you will grow to endear early married life is a time full of discovering one another's quirks
622,my new husband is constantly talking to himself,a rare topic & likely extremely troublesome for you i would need to have more background information on the two of you before beginning to offer any insight feel free to email mei would also like to add that aside from the reality of whether or not these conversations are actually occurring as your partner he should be just as concerned about something that is disturbing you to this level  partners need each others' trust and support no matter who is right or wrong
623,my parents are getting a divorce and i feel depressed,consider yourself quite normal for feeling overwhelmed and depressed about your parents divorce   this is the most natural way to feel at this timedepending on how old you are and whether you live under their roof  are dependent on their support and are either part of the decision or not of with whom and where you will live start considering these pointshow did you find out about the upcoming divorceare either of your parents reluctant to answer your questions or is it clear that neither of them want to talk about anything with youwhatever your fears and questions about your own future these are all real  it is necessary for you to know about your basic futureif you are living on your own and the main problem is your inner adjustment that your family structure is completely changing then probably a good therapist would be a great help to you now to clarify these tensionssending lots of good wishes for an easy resolution to your new path
624,my parents are threatening to get rid of the only things i still care about,it sounds to me like you have had a lot going on and now you are afraid you are going to lose the last things you care about your pets i do not know what all is going on in your family and i cannot answer for your dad’s actions or his reasoning behind thisi would recommend that you focus on developing healthy coping skills we cannot change what others do but we can change how what they do affects us if you have all of your emotions and all of yourself tied up into one thing then when that thing is taken away it causes a lot of emotional distress it is really good to have a wide variety of interests such as friends hobbies games etc develop other things that you care about and are passionate aboutanother reason for developing healthy coping skills to deal with whatever might be going on in your life is if you don’t have healthy ones you may develop some very unhealthy ones you have to cope somehow right developing unhealthy ways of coping with life is only going to make life more difficult for youi don’t know if this is what it is like for you at your house but there are two kinds of household environments that can cause dysfunction in children one is when you grow up in a very rigid stern household where all decisions are made for you and you feel like you have no control over anything the other is a household where things were chaotic and you never knew what was going to happen next and had no stability people need to have some stability in their lives and need to feel in control over some things in order to feel safe both of these environments can lead you to develop some unhealthy ways of coping with life please talk to a trusted adult about your feelings before it gets any worse
625,my parents are threatening to send me away if i do not play basketball for a team i hate,the situation in your family seems to place unnecessary pressure on youare you and your parents able to talk together about their reason for their standardare your parents willing to listen to your reasons to not play on the team you hateif yes then maybe some type of compromise is possible for all of you to negotiateif none of the above is possible then you may want to get specific and direct advice from a professional such as the school guidance counselor or psychologist whom you would trust and feel safe in talkingi hope you and your parents will find an answer that all of you are happy to accept
626,my parents are not letting my boyfriend and i talk or see each other while i am pregnant,you are not wrong for wanting to be with your boyfriend of three years who is also the biological father of your childdo your parents object to you and your boyfriend continuing to see each other in person  or do they object only to electronic communication and do not want him involved in his child's life ask your parents what their reason is for forbidding you to communicate with your boyfriend  ask them also to understand your point of viewnow is also a good time for you and your boyfriend to plan whether and where you will live as a family and how to financially and emotionally support one another once your baby is bornyour mom and dad are definitely making fatherhood difficult for your boyfriend and motherhood stressful for youconsider bringing up the topic during your next obgyn visit  your doctor may ask your mom to explain her reasons and address theselook online for womengs resources to see if there are clinics or agencies that would help you advocate for your position in this mattergood luck with the remainder of your pregnancy labor and delivery
627,my partner is bored of being intimate with me,i wonder how long anymore will be for your boyfriendsince you both are planning a long life together instead of his custom of ending relationships when he feels bored with the sex he will be facing the situation of being in a relationship and not having sex with his partner to whom he is committedwhat are your own views on the meaning of sex in a relationshipknowing this will help you be better able to collaborate with your boyfriend on finding ways of balancing what you each would like
628,my past is holding me back from my future how can i get my life back,have you explained to your prospective partner about the feeling of vulnerability which you have gotdisclosing one's truth to a trusted person will improve your sense of feeling safe and loved  it may also take off the pressure you feel to complete your own trajectory of making peace with your past burdens of ilifeif you find your possible new partner is patient and understanding then you have both removed pressure off yourself and will feel validated and loved for speaking your plain truth and finding it well acceptedif you continue to hide your deeper complexity or if you explain yourself and ask for the persongs patience and understanding and he avoids giving this to you then you are better off knowing sooner than later the limits of understanding which this potential partner has
629,my relationship feels off and i feel insecure,grief has a huge impact on us and everyone's reaction is different the one common reaction however is to shut down and distance ourselves her relationship with her grandmother was close given she took care of her up until she passed it sounds like she is working through a difficult loss and her ability to connect with you or anyone else is likely low right now trust what she is telling you and try to be there for her as she works through it if she finds it too difficult to connect again a good grief counselor can help her get back on track
630,my relationship is suffering from severe abandonment issues,this is an understandable response to early childhood trauma and loss  oftentimes when we have overwhelming or difficult experiences as a child including poor caregiving the ways we managed and the feelings we had then show up in our lives as adults  especially when we get close to someone it mirrors our early experiences with caregivers in early life  soour body nervous system and emotions respond in the same way  they feel as if what we experienced when we were little is happening now and they go into full force to manage and protect us  sometimes the ways that happens can feel pretty bad and we can stuck in these loops of old beliefs about ourselves  therapy is a great way to interrupt these patterns process the early experiences and be able to be in the present with your current relationships  it is very possible to shift this cycle and also have meaningful healing from the experiences that caused so much hurt and distress from childhood
631,my sexual partner wants me to reimburse him on a hotel room,hello and thank you for your question it really is up to you to decide if you owe him the $2500 if you feel like it is the right thing to do based on your discussion with him then pay when you can i am actually much more concerned with how he is treating you over $2500 i know that it can be a lot of money if you do not have much but that does not give someone the right to call you names and harass you through texts you may want to take some time and think about your relationship and make sure that these are the qualities and behaviors you want in a sexual partner be wellrobin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc
632,my sister and my husband had an affair,emotional pain is different from physical pain that way is not it even many years later an old wound can be ripped open again by a small triggeryou were betrayed by two people close to you that is a complex injury i do not know whether you are still in the marriage or not or whether your sister is still in your life perhaps not as your contact with her seems to be through watching her facebook activity i am curious about why you are just now seeing her facebook posts again are you feeling more open lately to seeing how she is doing in her life i guess if you were open to having your sister even in the periphery of your life again you will have to figure out how to handle those triggers if you cannot maybe consider unfollowing her or detaching from facebook for a while so your sister is happy or she at least appears happy your mind might go to some unhelpful places like she does not regret the affair  she does not deserve happiness  or she does not care that i am hurt  where does your mind go it is important to identify your worst thoughts in connection to her when you have those worst thoughts identified ask yourself what evidence supports that thought as truth it is likely that either there's no evidence or that the truth is so far from you that you cannot know what she is feeling or thinking which makes having those thoughts pretty futilea therapist can help you determine what emotions are being triggered here it does not help you and your happiness to carry around resentment ill wishes or the need for revenge forgiveness is not about saying that something was okay it is about saying it happened i accept that i cannot change it and i do not want to carry the emotional burden around all the time forgiveness is putting it down she she carries her own burden of shame for what she did for you to spend time feeling angry does not affect her burden it only adds to yours can you find the tender emotion under your anger you are hurt validate that hurt honour that hurt take care of that hurt you can stay away from people who disregard your needs and you have the power to forgive those who make mistakes out of their simple humanity if you want them in your life if you continue to struggle please seek the help of a professional who can assist you in navigating these waters 
633,my son and family has different views about religion how do i resolve these differences,i think the best thing you can do is be respectful of each family member's wishes although everyone may not agree with one another the most important thing you can do for each other is to respect their faith and beliefs instead of trying to sway them in a certain direction there are many families that are united despite their differences for example a mother may be catholic and the father jewish by introducing the children to each faith until they are ready to decide for themselves can be beneficial also it is not uncommon for views to change as one ages or faces different life experiences so do not get too discouraged if your child wants to explore different avenues creating a loving and accepting environment is most essential
634,my son plays alone at recess,it can be tricky to figure out if a child is truly satisfied with his lack of friendships parents can usually tell when their child is happy but kids who are unhappy may be masking disappointment perhaps acting out their feelings in an aggressive manner others may internalize symptoms appearing sad or withdrawn a parent may learn a great deal by asking the teachers questions such as whether the child works with others on group projects or if he eats lunch alone a parent can also talk with the recess supervisor about what happens on the playground and whether your child stays on the sidelines of play unsure of how to join the group therespectfully is a difference between kids who are shy but happy and kids who feel isolated because they do not know how to make friends itis not necessarily that there is something wrong with that child but they will in fact need help and suggestions for breaking into a peer group ask a child if there is someone he would like to have over to play if a mom or dad can make the play dates happen or if they hit on an activity the child truly enjoys the young person may begin to forge friendships on their own i encourage wellmeaning parents to choose words carefully use phrases like hey i noticed something or let me help you be successful by showing respect parents should feel more comfortable nudging their children beyond their comfort zonewhen to seek professional help when does isolation raise a red flag for longterm issues true personality disorders are not typically diagnosed until adulthood still professional counseling should be considered if the antisocial behavior is causing the child significant distress perhaps keeping him from functioning in everyday activities also parents should pay attention to how the child's social behavior changes over time such as social anxiety the vast majority of children who define quality time as time alone are perfectly happy healthy and normal if the child is able to nurture at least one friendship exhibiting what experts call social reciprocity then parents can relax and can cherish that child who enjoys the pleasure of his or her own company
635,my therapist betrayed my trust,do you want this therapist to have your credit card informationif not then cancel the credit cards that you believe may now be accessible to this therapisttherapists are expected to keep very clear boundaries between the therapy work and not have other relationships such as friend or money lender with someone who is their patienttherapists are never friends with their patientsletting you believe that you are the therapist's friend is a violation of professional ethics and almost definitely a violation of the consumer protection laws in your statestart by dropping this person as your therapist  he has broken too many ethical standards to be worthy of offering therapythink over if you would like remaining friends with this person whom you describe as lacking integrity and stealing from youif you need help getting back money from him then contact the police and talk to a detective about what has happened so far  the detective will advise according to the laws in your community and state whether to file a police report and what steps are necessary to utilize the court system to get back your fundsif you would like doing future patients who may be treated to similar ways by this therapist a favor go online and file a complaint with the therapist's licensing boardgood luck
636,my toddler wants her daddy to die when she is mad at him,children often have a difficult time expressing emotions accurately it is also very likely that your daughter does not understand  the permanence of death having said that she is using some very specific ideas here and i would recommend contacting a local mental health professional with some experience working with childreni would also wonder where she is getting this idea sometimes children hear things on tv or from an adult and we are not even aware of how much they are rememberingit may be helpful to teach her things that she can do when she is angry like say that she is mad because she cannot have the toy that she is asking fori am curious as to how long it is that she stays mad like this and whether she talks to her dad after she is no longer angry does she say the same sorts of things about youit may also be helpful for you to work with a mental health professional so that you can have some support with this as well
637,my wife and i have been married for over 3 years and we are tired of having sex,to begin with what's normal for one couple is not going to be normal for the next every couple has their own normal and that is important to keep in mind your sexual lives will ebb and flow what i would be more curious about is the quality rather than the quantity of the sex you are having i would also want you both to refocus on building up your little daily moments of connection i wrote a post about exactly that a while back and you can find it here
638,my wife does not want to have sex,that sounds really challenging for both of you differences in sexual desire between partners is common and can create real friction and conflict i would encourage you to do some couples counselling or sex therapy as often these issues can be worked through and low sexual desire can result from relational fears and misunderstandings or sex that is not as arousing as is possible there are some good videos on this resource page about sexuality and intimacy and a video that specifically addresses desire differences in relationships
639,my wife has a diminished libido and is faking orgasms and denying it what do i do,you are newly married you have a hectic schedule your wife is on anti anxiety medication what if you take the focus off of her orgasms and focus instead on connecting with one another you know like the gestures you each likely made while dating  it turns out that these little moments of connection throughout our days are actually foreplay spend a few weeks making a real effort to focus on building up your little daily moments of connection i wrote a post about this a while back you can find it here httpconnectfulnesscomlittlemoments and have fun with it
640,my wife is cheating and won’t tell me the truth,hi prattville i am sorry this is happening to you you need support right now and yes you need answers she is in denial and is trying to hide the truth to protect herself this is a natural behaviour you do not indicate whether she wants the marriage or is planning to leave which way you go from here depends in part on the answer to that question if she wants the marriage you certainly have the right to say i need answers to all my questions giving you the information she needs has to be more important than protecting herself i would support your right to advocate for all the information you need in order to feel secure or make decisions she may fear that the truth will turn you away if you want to you can reassure her that you want the marriage no matter what the truth is if the marriage is to survive it needs opennessif on the other hand she is planning to end the marriage then you might want to resign yourself to the fact that you may never get the information you seek you are better off in that case seeking support from friends and family rather than beating on a closed door your wife has some decisions to make try to give her a bit of time to make them you can patiently say i know this thing is happening talk to me so we can deal with it together i want to move forward but i need the truth only time will tell which way this one will go individually you can seek professional help as well
641,my wife no longer wants sex,hi hamptonalthough i would bet your wife also wants the attention and companionship it seems that there are a few barriers in your sexual relationship right now i also would bet that there are things that your wife would like from you this is a very common issue two people with different sexual drives or needs if you both want the relationship to improve a couple's therapist who works in sexuality is a great idea it is a complex picture that you have only given us a glimpse ofin the meantime you can try a few things have compassion for your wife she is in pain and this may preoccupy her sex may be uncomfortable for her she needs understanding you need understanding too right  help her to see that you are not just angry but lonely and hurt it might affect how you see yourself as a man showing her irritability or anger might push her farther awaythere are many ways to be close intimate and sexual that do not involve intercourse you might want to explore some of these things and reassure her that you will not pressure her to have intercourse find out what your wife's wishes and ideas are you might be surprisedthese things take time to address especially if they have been years in the making i do recommend seeing that therapist relationships are very complex and it takes time to explore all the layers and barriers to change best of luck
642,my wife outed me to her sister,i am so sorry this happened  sharing a part of your private life without your permission can be so painful  i might suggest reaching out to your sister and discussing this   i might also speak with your wife and share how hurt you are and what you need to happen moving forward to begin to heal
643,my wife will not do things she used to do,i would say you are letting fear get a hold on you you would really enjoy some sexual activities that your wife has not initiated in a long while but it is a big leap to go from that to i married the wrong person fear is telling you that she does not respect or like or want you look at the bigger picture what is the evidence that your wife wants to please youthat she is the right woman for youthat she loves youthat she cares about what's important to you  if there is evidence there then you owe it to the marriage to rein in your fearful thoughtstalking to your wife is so important right now we all have moments when we really just want to sit and stew in our self pity over our partner not vacuuming or cooking or saying loving things often enoughbut they cannot read our minds can you lovingly let her know what you miss what you hope forwhat you need this is the meat of a loving relationship sharing who we are so that we can love each other better your wife deserves the benefit of the doubt that she will listen to what you long for can you risk feeling vulnerable you cannot control her answer but can you trust her to care
644,no matter what i do my mom will almost always find something wrong with it,it is challenging to see one's parents age and to cope with the new demands  your mom means a lot to you and that is why you get easily frustrated  i am guessing that it is not that she is making you do work or that her expectations are nonimportant to you because if that were the case you would not feel any guilt  accepting the new stage will help you cope with the changes  take a deep breath every time you feel frustrated and think of the good times you shared with your mom before her getting alzheimer's  remember that your mom as she was is no longer and that she has reverted to a more delicate phase  also schedule time for yourself and do things that help you relax  caretaking of an elderly parent can take a toll on you and it is essential to incorporate selfcare  finally look for an alzheimer's support group in your area that will help you connect with other people going through the same thing  you are a good daughter and your mom is lucky to have you in her lifesincerely mirellaimage and likeness counseling
645,our grandson wants to talk to his estranged mom,hi boone this depends a lot on his age and the situation the younger the child is in general the more i would see this as your decision not his a child of any age should be listened to carefully about these matters but just because a child has unresolved issues about a parent does not necessarily mean that having contact is a good solution some questions was the parent harmful to the child is the parent likely to be harmful to the child how likely is it to be a positive experience do you have any contact with the parent you may want to speak with the parent first to determine whether they are in a stable enough place to allow this to happen  i would start by asking the child more about what is on his mind what does he want to get out of a visit with the parent is it to see them and know the parent is okay to get an apology to apologize for a perceived hurt to have regular contact to find out if they are loved what does he hope mom or dad might do or say in the visit there are many possible goals this child might have in mind this will give you a sense of what's missing for the child what need are they trying to fill once you know the need try to determine the likelihood of that need being met successfully through contactonce you determine the risk of the child's need not being met then you decide whether it makes sense  the older the child the more able they are to determine this with you or for themselves there are other options than a facetoface he can write to his mom or dad text or email it is likely that the child is looking for a sense that he is loved wanted worth some effort when a child is separated from a parent they tend to blame themselves whether he sees the parent or not he will need extra love attention and support than a child who has two loving present parents i wish him the best and i am grateful for the love and support you continue to give your grandson you are very special
646,overcoming fears,fears are not that difficult to deal with first you need to train yourself to relax using some relaxation strategy once you are able to employ that in your daily life you then need to start facing your fear for instance i will use an example of a man who has a fear of driving over a bridge we would build a hierarchy of fears that is a list of fears ranging from least to most for example the man may want to start by looking at a picture of a bridge while employing his relation technique then he may want to see a real bridge from a distance while employing that same relaxation technique then moving closer to the bridge then maybe standing on a bridge all the while moving closer to his fear while relaxing until you come to most fearful proposition which is crossing that bridge or you can also engage in flooding which is for example if you were scared of an elevator go into an elevator until you are not panicking anymore in the movie batman begins bruce wayne who has a great fear of bats goes into this cave and allows himself to be surrounded by bats until he is no longer fearful of them secondly look at your fears do they even need to be worked on some fears are healthy for example if i was a therapist in new york city and someone came to me and said i am scared of snakes i would probably say that is ok because there are very little snakes left in manhattanhope that helps c
647,ptsd is impacting my whole life,slowly is the rate at which you will get back your lifebeing traumatized means not feeling safe in almost all areas of lifebe patient with yourself as you try to regain trust that people will not harm you and will be sources of satisfaction in your lifeit is possible that the trauma in your life requires such great attention on your part to your own inner emotional safety that you are better off with a less intensive job than the one you recently losttry to prioritize restoring your emotional and psychological health  with this as the top area of your attention then you may have an easier time to accept a lesser degree of involvement in your work and relationshipswhen you feel angry try to examine if underlying the anger are feelings of stress fear insecurity regarding your position in relationship to the person toward whom you feel angry   anger is often the surface reaction to more destabilizing emotions like fear and insecuritygradually by nurturing and comforting yourself living at a pace which is uniquely comfortable to what and how much you can handle you will regain your trust in both yourself and relating to others
648,people make me sick,sounds like you are dealing with a lot within your self which is causing you great pain  i would suggest that first you get a full physical evaluation to make sure that you are ok physically  then getting a mental evaluation as well from a psychiatrist  seeing both would help rule out any physically or psychologically causes to your symptoms    after getting these evaluations your physician should be able to help guide you on what treatments would be the best to help with your everyday challenges your are facing  whether treatment includes medication andor psychotherapist would be discussed  please consider doing both immediately so you can have the live you want everyday you wake up
649,relationships cause me anxiety and nausea,hi helenai felt a bit sad when i read this this is a new term for me semirelationship what does it mean i know that today's culture for young people is more of a hookup culture than a dating one maybe that means that you develop connections to people but you keep yourself from hoping for a full relationship because no one is doing that anymore that makes me feel sad i hear a lot of young women say that they struggle with hookups because they cannot let themselves hope for a phone call after a hookup research tells us that after a hookup college age women tend to feel used and unworthy and men tend to feel guilty i think this scenario works better for men than women but many of both genders are left unsatisfied in the endthis is only one possible explanation for your anxietythat your gut knows that it wants to feel fully coupled with someone but you struggle with whether it is okay to want or expect thatmaybe take a moment and listen to anxiety anxiety tends to try to convince us that something's wrong with us or something bad's going to happen anxiety sometimes prefers to stay vague  but you can try to clarify it is whisperings by asking yourself these questions what am i afraid of what is the worst thing that might happen here then what might happen and what would be the worst part of that keep going until you find the very worst thing that might happen might someone not want youmight you feel rejectedor feel not good enoughyou might get hurtthen when you find that core fear you can look at your life and i bet you would find a place where that idea or fear originated a big moment when you actually did feel or get rejected or abandoned or hurt in the end it is a feeling you are trying to avoid  and anxiety is trying to help you avoid it by making you overcautious but this does not work for you good with the help of a qualified therapist you can learn to talk back to anxiety and move forward in life and love with calm confidence
650,should i be concerned that my boyfriend will not introduce me to a female friend,would you have the same desire to meet this friend if she were a he if you are concerned that their friendship is a substitute for you when you are not present talk to him it sounds like you are concerned that he is building an emotional intimacy with her and spending time doing the sort of things with her that you would otherwise be doing with him help him understand why this bothers you but try to also be open to allowing him to make friends is the issue that he has not introduced you is there another reason you do not trust their friendship
651,should i be upset that my husband may have lied to me again,imagine your best friend just told you that her husband lied to her all the time and that he had broken every promise he ever made to her what would you tell her if i were her best friend i would tell her to run the other way you may love this man we do not choose who we love but the evidence is pretty clear is not it a healthy relationship cannot be built on a foundation of lies and broken promises i believe that as adults we are always treated as well as we insist on being treated by our partners if you continue to accept unacceptable behavior you are likely to see lots more of it
652,should i break up with my livein girlfriend,hi fort worth  i applaud your awareness and insight into the relationship  most of us come into relationships carrying old baggage and although you cannot change her  what you can do is change yourself  we can usually begin to understand ourselves better in the context of our own upbringings  that is where we learn what a relationship looks like and it is often not the best teacher  i wonder about your jealously insecurity feeling trapped and a lack of trust  has that ever showed up anywhere before  it has more to do with you and less to do with her   your relationship with her is tapping into unresolved issues within yourself  that is really where you want to focus once you understand it and resolve it you will no longer need to ask anyone else what to do because you will know  you are young and just getting started in the relationship world and the healthier you are the better you will know what healthy looks like   know yourself understand yourself and love yourself  the rest will take care of itself  finding a therapist can be a big help in this process  you are asking the question so i suspect you are ready to look at the man in the mirror  i believe in you and am wishing you all the bestsandra cooper rn lpcmh

656,should i get a new therapist,it can be really frustrating to feel like your counselor is not providing you with the help you needmy recommendation in a situation like this would be to let your counselor know how you feel specifically tell your counselor that you do not seem to be getting the amount of feedback you would likeif this does not help then you might want to look for another counselor who will be a better fit for you
657,should i get back together with my exboyfriend who has trust issues,i am truly sorry to hear that your relationship is causing you such distress at this time when we are in relationships trust is so integral to our satisfaction within the relationship  often when we feel we are required to prove ourselves feelings of resentment can replace those feelings of wanting to be supportive  in situations like this i often recommend being open and honest in your communication with your partner  your fears about his response are valid as he made an assumption which you cannot disprove because you cannot battle against a shadow fact if you feel comfortable doing so you can always ask him why he is so concerned you are unable to remain faithful and challenge those beliefs with the facts that disclaim them  you can also ask your partner what it is that he needs from you to help you to help him trust in your responses  in the end these are issues that you cannot conquer for him  you can only guide him and show him the path towards trust  you may suggest couples counselling or that he seek out a professional to talk to as well  but in terms of your question only you can decide whether you feel you can remain in a relationship in which you defend yourself against an uncommitted offense
658,should i give him another chance,people do not cheat bc of miscommunication   people cheat bc they feel diminished regard for their partneryou pulling away does not explain his behaviorif the two of you still were a couple at the time he cheated on you then there were many alternatives he cold have taken besides disrespecting youtry to understand whether you are satisfied and happy in the relationship  your actions sound as though you are not either of thesewhether or not you decide to be together again many depend too on if the trust you had in him is restored  do you feel you can trust him againif the two of discuss your relationship then if you do not trust him right now and the both of you talk about your dynamics then tell him about your feelingstrust is foundational to feeling safe and happy in a relationship
659,should i go back on my medicine,deciding whether or not psychiatric medicine is a good option can be complicated as you have noticed and only a person who is licensed to prescribe can give you medical advice regarding medications while there is sometimes relief from symptoms from medication as you have pointed out there are often negative side effects as well while i cannot give you advice on whether or not to continue medication i would urge you to take an inventory of the positive and negative effects that you have noticed and educate yourself as much as possible about the short and longterm costs and benefits of psychiatric medication if you can find a doctor psychiatrist or arnp who is competent in mental health it may also benefit you to consult with themone thing that i am wondering about is what is your support system like in regards to your fight against depression are you seeing a therapist or attending any therapeutic or supportive group while there are many things that one can do on their own to work through challenges such as depression psychotherapy has been shown time and again in research to be highly effective and sometimes having a relationship with a caring competent professional who understands depression and ways of helping can make a huge difference
660,should i just move on from my demanding girlfriend,love is not enough to keep a relationship togetherthe people need to get along happily toolet's start with knowing more about your happiness in being with your partnerthe frequent break ups happen for a reason  try understanding more of why you go back together againyou state a few very clear reasons to not continue this relationship such as feeling like crap and not liking that your girlfriend hopes her  partner will feel afraid to leave hertrust your intuition telling you that these feelings mattersometimes men are not sure whether following their instinct is a right action to takeit isalso hoping a partner will fear losing them shows a wish to control a personcontrol has nothing to do with love and trust and these are basics of a relationshipgood luck
661,should i leave my boyfriend,hi lockport building a relationship when there are already children involved is very tricky you do not tell us whether you live together or not if you do your position is perhaps more difficult because his daughter's behaviours affect you you live in the home a bottom line for me is you do not tell someone else how to parent that is for your boyfriend to decide when he is there he is the parent and he makes the decisions about how she is disciplined  even if you have good ideas or you completely disagree or you think you see something that he is not seeing it is simply not for you to interfere there it sounds like your boyfriend is struggling emotionally and needs support he has had a lot of losses in his life and maybe every time his daughter leaves he feels powerless and abandoned do you talk about these things can you find that line of supporting him but not telling him what to doalthough i suggest you leave the parenting to him what you can do is tell him what you see offer suggestions if he is open to it and talk about the ways in which the situation affects you it makes sense to say i see you struggling and i do not know how to help i have noticed that you seem afraid to discipline her are you aware that it is coming across this way do you need help or i feel sad and frustrated when we do not spend any time alone together you sound a bit resentful of his daughter is it possible that your real struggle is about whether you are ready to be in a relationship with a man whose priority is his childyou have a voice and it is great to offer support and ideas and let him know how you feel ultimately however you are wise to accept this man as who he is and accept the situation for what it is and make your own decision about whether you want to be a part of it 
662,should i let my boyfriend go,sorry to hear about all the stress in the relationshipyou are on the right track by knowing and sticking with your own standards of what qualifies as acceptable behavior by your boyfriendsince he was the one who broke your trust he is one in the position of earning back your trustthis is always a basic formula for couple's therapy in which there has been infidelityunderstand within yourself whether you would like being with your boyfriend and what you would like him to do so that you start feeling more secure in the relationshipif yes then tell him what you now know about yourself as partner in the relationshipfor example some people who are getting over being cheated on would like knowing details about the affair person some people want to see the phone of the one who cheatedrecuperating after a cheating incident takes many monthsif he tells you he would like earning back your trust give him some time to see if there is progress in this areaas results unfold you will feel clearer on the direction your relationship is naturally takingabout the girl at work she will feel less meaningful to you as you work together with your boyfriend on securing the relationshipshe has her greatest meaning right now because you are at the beginning stage of knowing what direction to takeas you go along this road more than likely you will be more at ease in naturally finding a way of relating to her that feels ok to you
663,should i let the father of my kids go,your story sounds like it gives you a great deal of tension and disappointmentyou know you are not getting the amount of love and kind of relationship you would likeit is almost as though you feel that something is better than nothingreflect within yourself whether the balance of what you receive in this relationship is worth the sacrifice of not getting as much love as you wishdepending on your decision you will know whether to drop this relationship or continue the same as its been
664,should i message my crush,it is never to late to let a person know how you feel  you never know where it will take you  you do not want to hold this regret of not letting your feelings known and wondering what if for the rest of your life   that can be torturous   now prepare for whateverif his feelings are the same or if they are not  if they are the samegreat  if they are not feel good that at least you let a person know they hold a special place in your life and wish him love peace and happiness in his life
665,should i move on from my exhusband,it is not uncommon for relationships to go cold over time it is a matter of one or the other becoming complacent if you and your husband have been together for quite some time it is likely that you are very comfortable and familiar with each other while this is a good thing in some ways it can also become boring and you run the risk of losing that in love feeling he is referring to couples simply become ambivalent for some of the couples i work with in my practice i find that helping to organize a time apart which i call a therapeutic separation can do wonders for the relationship i offer homework to be done during this time reading worksheets and individual counseling helps people learn more about themselves and what they desire out of their relationship it often times brings more appreciation for their partners when the pair comes back together we are able to push the reset button and begin a new chapter that is more fulfilling and exciting than before

667,should i stay with my manipulative husband,i think your own awareness will not allow you to continue in a bad relationshipbe glad something within you is telling you that there are better ways to be treated than how your husband doesfor support and guidance in real time look up the organizations in your area which help women to leave abusive relationshipsyou are not the first or only one and probably not the last woman who wants to leave an abusive partner  having guidance particular to you and your situation will help you move through what decisions to make as to how to leave this man
668,should i take my daughter to therapy,hi dilloni am from canada so i do not know the laws in your state it depends on that a good deal perhaps in my opinion a child should never be forced into a situation where they feel unsafe even if it is supervised if the child is old enough to make a strong statement about not wanting to see a parent then this should be honoured unfortunately the laws do not always uphold a parent's right to do what is best for their child i recommend you see a lawyer who will advise you about how to proceed without putting yourself at risk of breaching custody agreementsif you feel your daughter can benefit from therapy that is a separate question or is she already in therapy a family therapist will typically meet with you alone first in order to determine if therapy is a wise move for your child it is not always appropriate
669,should i talk honestly to my brother about his girlfriend risking our own relationship,this is tricky and quite delicatei wonder if you could talk with your brother about whether he would be willing to have a discussion with you about something that is important to you i would also suggest trying to make clear your true intentions for exampletelling him that he has the right to do what he wants with who he chooses to datethat you are talking to him about this because you care about himthat your relationship with him is important to you and that you love him and care about himalso try to stick to examples or ideas that are objectively observable  that way you are using facts rather than opinions and things that can be observed rather than subjective emotional decisionsi would also be curious with what your brother sees in this girl and i might even recommend starting with thati cannot underline enough the importance of having this come across as genuine and for lack of a better word gentlei also be very honest with you that i cannot guarantee that he will react positively neutrally or even that he will have the discussion with youbecause it is true that he could choose to continue dating this girl and perhaps even hold it against you for a while i would also encourage you to look at the importance of this to you and where you consider the riskbenefit ratio to be
670,should i tell my kids that santa is real after their dad told them he is not,well boise the cat's out of the bag now is not it i love that you want to help your kids keep the magic of christmas they must want that too if they still believe in santa into their teen years which is unusual i believe i wonder if they had already figured it out anywaybut they know now and your ex had the right to tell them if he felt it was best so it is time to explain to them what a loving and magical thing it is that parents do and christmas can still be magical in so many ways really who says they have to stop believing in santa santa is very real as a spirit of surprise generosity and love
671,should i tell my separated wife that i am expecting a child with the woman i am dating,only tell your former girlfriend who is the mother of your son what is necessary for her to know as it relates to your sonthe mother of your son has every right as a parent to know who is directly involved in her songs lifefirst figure out how you will handle your current girlfriend's request to end the relationship you have with herwithout knowing whether you are in a relationship or not is a key piece of information which the mother of your son would likely have interest to know and be entitled to knowalso love is never enough to keep a marriage working  love is a wonderful emotion only managing daily life and family decisions requires commitment to the other personreflect within yourself if you are willing to commit to your current girlfriend   then you would have a substantial offer to make to her of your willingness to be together with her
672,should i wait for this guy to make a move or just move on,well as disappointed as you may very well feel from hearing this guy's answer you know he does not want a relationshipwhat type of move would you like him to makeif you mean you would be happy to have sex with this guy and not a relationship then wait for as long as your patience allowsto wait for him to change his mind that he does want a relationship does not have a very strong base on which to standits possible to do this only consider the emotional price of your frustration to wait for someone to change their mind
673,should my stepdaughters be told that their stepfather has a child pornography addiction,if the daughters are old & mature enough to understand substance abuse  they should be told for their own empowerment knowledge is their power of safety and protection
674,should my wife and i seek any kind of counseling if she is convinced our marriage is over and has turned romantic love into platonic love,hi portlandthis must feel like your world is turned upside down for your wife to declare her confusion followed closely by resignation followed closely by a new friend i get how upsetting this isif i was your therapist i would want to explore this a good deal because there are several possibilities concerning what might be happening be careful not to jump to conclusions sometimes people have been slowly falling out of love for a long time and often this is due to some unmet need in the marriage she may have been coming to this point over a period of time and has only finally said so it is also possible that your wife is going through some temporary crisisshe is changing and personally unhappy and blaming the marriage for it only she can help herself through this  or it is possible she is met this new friend and her attachment to him has clouded her view or clarified something for her  right now it is important that you respect your wife's decision to separate if she is asking for that we cannot trap people in a marriage if she needs separation or distance then it is respectful to give her thatthat does not mean that you have to give up on the marriage right now i would seek the support of a therapist who can help you sort out what you want whether it is to move on with your life or wait patiently for a period of time i cannot predict what will happen here but you can find out what the best path for you is i wish you the best
675,should we put off kids until my husband is mentally cured,probably the more important questions to answer concern how much confidence you have in you and your boyfriend becoming parents how you each feel about the influence of his being banned from seeing his current children and be clear about the circumstances that led up to the decision of him not being permitted to see his kidsdo not allow some random professional to pronounce your boyfriend as cured  a relatively qualified therapist would never make this callpsychological and emotional tensions emerge from our relationships within families  you and your boyfriend are in a position to set a strong foundation for having children assuming each of you wants childrenchildhood issues your boyfriend's anyone's are more likely to go away when new patterns of interacting emergeif the two of you are engaged in setting a secure relationship as future parents the disappointments and hurt from the very early years will be replaced by better ways of interacting
676,sleeping anger and anxiety,hi there i have to commend you on reaching out to get some answers on why you are feeling the way that you are feeling a lot of people secretly go about their lives every day feeling this way because they are too afraid of what the answer might befirst off what stressors do you have in your life right now financial relationship and unemployment are all common stressors for people they can often make it difficult for us to sleep at night due to the constant racing thoughts and wonders of how you will deal with it all secondly do you have a history of depression or does depression run in your family some of the symptoms listed here in this question are all common symptoms of depression often times these symptoms can be overlooked and mistaken for just being tired furthermore it is important to ask yourself if you are feeling worthless problems with concentration and recurrent thoughts of death if you are having these symptoms please seek help immediately lastly considering your stated symptoms i would recommend reaching out to your doctor for further consult it is always better to be safe and the earlier you catch the symptoms the faster you will get to feeling better do some helpful tips for the your doctor would be to monitor your sleep habits  make a list of your triggers for your anger outbursts as well as your triggers for your anxiety attacks i hope this was helpful and the best of luck to you
677,some adult family members are acting erratically in my house,hi this sounds like a very challenging and upsetting problem  good for you for reaching out my first thought is these two adults may have a sleep disorder that could be contributing to the urination in inappropriate places since they are adults and you cannot force them to seek treatment  you might be able to suggest that there could be an underlying medical issue and advise they speak with a medical provider  as far as what to do for yourself  set some firm boundaries be clear about the expectations of your home also include the positive and negative consequences should they decide to address or avoid this issue i hope this helps you your family members and the pets
678,the underlying causes of being possessive,hi there it is great you are able to realize there are other issues going on with someone who feels possessive at the root of it is fear fear of losing someone fear of being alone fear of not being good enough all those fears can lead to low selfesteem and feeling like you have to control other people so you do not lose them the thing is controlling other people only pushes them away vicious circle right what i would suggest is some cognitive therapy to change those underlying ways of thinking you can start with this assignment write down all the things you think about yourself positive and notsopositive then rewrite those notsopositive things so they are positive for example thinking something like i am too pushy can be rewritten as i am assertive and i go after what i want it can be hard to do since we tend to get stuck in our negative ways of thinking about ourselves if you have someone you trust you can ask for their help as well since most likely they see you differently than you see yourselffinding a good cognitive therapist can help you further but if that is not an option for you right now there are lots of selfhelp books and websites that are out there you have already taken the first step so keep moving forward
679,the child i nanny hates me,it does not sound like he hates you just misses mom and dad in the mornings you could validate his feelings by saying something like i know you want to see mom and dad right now but they are working and then give him a couple options of things that may take his mind off of it this could be choosing what he has for breakfast or playing a game of his choice if possible it may also be helpful if you could create a routine in which he stops by mom and dad to say good morning if this is routine he will come to understand that he will be able to see mom and dad for a minute and not become anxious about seeing them
680,the girls at my comingofage party do not like their dresses,how did you find out that the girls are not happy with their dressesdid you hear this directly from one of them or is this third hand information that someone else told you about one of the girls in your partythe answer matters because gossiping instead of directly telling you about a problem is a problem in itselfi suggest a conversation with the entire group of girls in which you tell them how you actually are feeling about their opinions about the dressesone topic you may consider bringing up is what everyone expects to get out of the party  are they coming because they like one another and wearing a dress in which the girl is happy is only one way of having fun togetheryou may learn a great deal as to the difference in values about a quinceaña among you and your friendsi hope you will have a fun party
681,the love of my life wants to try getting back together with her child's father,that sounds really heartbreaking it is tough falling in love and not being able to dive fully because of complications on the other side it sounds to me that you are doing exactly what you need to be doing by taking care of myself while the rest sorts itself out while i admire your desire and courage to stay friends  the extreme pain that you mentioned may make this too challenging and at odds with your taking care of yourself since there is no commitment on her end to give it a shot with you i would make sure that you really honour your own feelings about what feels right to you so that you do not end up feeling strung along or resentful make sure that you lean on friends and family at this time  we need all the support that we can get when we are heartbroken
682,the organization i work for has told me i cannot go to my 12 step meetings,you definitely want to make sure not to inadvertently create an inappropriate dual relationship with a client in fact it is not uncommon for state regulatory boards to determine that a clinician and client being in the same 12 step group is professional misconduct you might want to consider attending a 12 step meeting that is located in a different community than the one you work in  another option would be to look for oneonone or small group recovery support
683,there's this girl i have been dating for months,it can be really difficult when someone you care about does not feel the same about you the most important thing to remember is that you can not make her feel a certain way  there is nothing you can do to force her to want to be in a relationship with youin the end if she just wants to be friends then she is probably not the right match for youremember every relationship ends  until that last one that does not  and that is how it is supposed to be
684,thoughts of afterlife causes anxiety,you might be surprised how normal you are anxiety is incredibly common and while your particular type of existential anxiety might be unique to you  it is very difficult for most people to really comprehend what happens after we die  regardless of the religious or philosophical belief systems we hold it is the ultimate unknown and some philosophers and psychologists believe that at the root of our daytoday anxieties is the fear of death or fear of the unknown  just as it can be really hard to comprehend the ending of life it can also be hard to comprehend an eternal existence what these both have in common is that we are imaging a future that is ultimately unknowable and this unknown can provoke a lot of anxiety mindfulness based practices like meditation  maybe there is something like this in your religious tradition  can be very helpful in making peace with the unknown in the present moment the more we can learn to live in the moment  the less we get hung up on anticipating outcomes for our lives that may never come true mindfulness practices can help you ground be where you are  relax and regulate your nervous system so that you are able sleep and recuperate and train your attention to focus on living the life you want to live now  rather than worrying about what happens after you die having said all that  it can be profoundly helpful to speak with someone about your anxiety  especially when you feel haunted by it worry that you are crazy and cannot get to sleep there are lots of good therapists out there who can help you with your anxiety
685,unethical therapy practices,this sounds like a potentially serious situation the most important thing is to make sure the child is safe  if you suspect that a child is harmed i would strongly recommend that you report your concerns to your local law enforcement or to child protective services if you do not think that a child is in danger you can still report your suspicion of counselor misconduct to the state regulatory board
686,what are some physical signs of psychosis,do an internet research on psychosis symptoms and see if you have several of the symptoms  if you do seek a medical evaluation from your primary care physician  there are great medications and psychotherapy that can help you live your life to the fullest  there a many people who are diagnosed with psychosis and living a productive life
687,what are the best ways to reduce anxiety,something to remember about anxiety is that it is a useful and necessary response to stressors and we all have a level of anxiety that falls somewhere on the spectrum from very slight to very overwhelming anxiety is our braings way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple the first i would recommend is a calm breathing technique  breathe in for 45 seconds and then out for 78 seconds try to repeat this for 35 minutes another suggestion is to pay closer attention in the moments you feel the physical symptoms of anxiety and see if you can describe  without judging  the sensations to yourself try to be very specific such as my palms are feeling very sweaty and i can feel the slight tightness and fluttering in my belly of the butterflies then try to sit with these sensations without deciding if they are good or bad  just experiencing them as intentionally as possible  combining the calm breathing with this technique can also be very helpful if you feel that these techniques do not help and your anxiety about everyday stressors are inhibiting you from being able to engage in life the way you want to then i would highly recommend going for an assessment or even just consultation with a professional this professional can help you determine if therapycounseling would be helpful for you to develop additional skills for managing those interfering anxiety symptoms
688,what are the long term effects of losing one's adopted mother,the true answer is no one can really say with certaintythe variables are the way this child absorbs and adjusts to these significant changes in their life  all anyone can do is guess at this point and there's no good reason to guessthe only general certainty is that the adult whom this child becomes will have had a profound encounter with the biggest types of human losses a child can go throughsome people become great teachers therapists and philosophers who have this background  some give up on life and hide away from othersthe best anyone could do who knows this child is to offer love bc this is the greatest guarantee to show there are good people on this earth
689,what are the skills needed by a counselor,here is a list of skills i use every session and a short explanation of what they arereflecting paraphrasing what clients have said so that they know you understand themvalidating helping clients to know that their point of view is valuable and rationalclientcentered talk maintaining focus on the client in therapy sessions rather than a therapist talking about themselvesattending nonverbal or verbal cues that indicate i am listening to a client reframing helping a client to see a problematic behavior or situation in a different way 
690,what can i communicate with a person who is sensitive to negativity in a disagreement,with any type of criticism it is usually best to introduce the topic at a neutral time ie when both of you are relaxed with no current stressors involved having fun etc  begin with a nonjudgmental reflective comment about a recent bothersome event as if it were just then crossing your mind then share how you felt at the time of the event  just say when i felt kind of hurt  shocked   period  thats all you should say  wait for him to respond to your matteroffact statementno matter what his response is stick to your same message  do not get overwhelmed by trying to rephrase or explain your view as that will likely set you up for continued arguing  you can even add i agree i could have misunderstood  it  i just know it made me feel uneasyhere you give him little wiggle room for a debategood luck & i would love to hear how it goes
691,what can i do about my boyfriend being so close with another girl,i wonder if you could have a conversation with your boyfriend about how you are feeling a few things may help with thattry having the conversation you are both able to have a conversation about something that is important maybe your boyfriend will be willing to listen to you for about five minutes asking questions to learn more about your experience kind of like an investigative reporter wouldsee if your boyfriend is able to capture the essence of what you are saying by summarizing it for youremember that hearing you and following what you are saying does not mean that he agreesalso consider if there are events in your past that are affecting the way you are looking at this relationship between your boyfriend and this other girl then you can switch so that you can hear more about what he is experiencing also consider having a discussion that if one of you becomes very emotional and needs a break from the discussion discuss having a timeout that will last for a certain time frame and then come back to continue the discussionremember that the goal here is just to learn more about what each of you is going through not to find a solution right awaythis can be difficult consider working with a couples therapist to discuss it together
692,what can i do about my boyfriend insulting my body,my first thought was that i wondered what changed recently is he open to having a discussion about this so you can ask questions such as that oneit is possible that he does not understand the degree to which it hurts youtry asking if there is a time that would be good to have a discussion that is important i do not know how well the two of you have communicated over the last year but if you are concerned about this turning into an argument you may consider asking him to just listen to your point of view and see if he is able to summarize it correctly then you can listen to his side of the concern
693,what can i do about my boyfriend's verbal abuse,because of the way that you say your boyfriend is only calm when he is drinking and you have concerns about flights it would probably be most helpful for you to speak with a local therapist so you can have specific conversations about what happens during these fightswhen you do everything right are you saying that you do not argue it sounds a bit as though you are trying to read each other's mind without being able to communicate effectively i recommend working on this with a therapist though  so that you can talk about specific strategies and what you can do when he is not calm
694,what can i do about my children blaming me for their addictions,blaming others is one of our greatest coping mechanisms  it is not just for addiction and often we blame the ones closest to us  you can not stop them from blaming you you can stop yourself for taking on the burden  we are all in charge of the choices we make  no one makes us do something other than our self  we choose how we internalize and react to situations  i would find a good therapist who understands family dynamics and addiction to help you cope with your current environment and help you move forward
695,what can i do about my dad being on drugs,it seems like you are going trough stages of grief since the inability to see your father causes you similar feelings as if you had lost him  perhaps you could send him letters expressing your feelings and hopes  but do understand that if he is under the influence of drugs he might not be able to empathize with your feelings or react in the way that he would have done so in the past  as the issue evolves find a therapist or counselor to help you work on letting go of that anger and stress which may affect you negatively  find forgiveness so you can have a relationship with him in the future  ¿qué puedo hacer con mi padre usuario de drogasmi papa está usando drogas muy malas y no estoy autorizada a verlo por lo que me puede hacer a mí y a mis hermanos  esto afecta mi vida tremendamente  me causa coraje  estrésparece que estas pasando por estados de luto ya que el no poder ver a tu padre causa sentimientos similares a cuando hay una perdida  tal vez puedes escribirle cartas expresando tus sentimientos y esperanzas  pero comprende que si el está bajo la influencia de drogas puede que no sienta empatía o te responda como lo solía hacer  mientras el problema se resuelve busca un consejero o terapeuta que te ayude a trabajar en resolver los sentimientos de coraje y estrés trabaja también en perdonarlo para que puedas tener una relación con él en el futuro
696,what can i do about my dad,if you are actually able to afford to move out and support your own life then this is a reasonable choiceif you are not in such a position and must continue for a while to live w your dad then emotionally protect yourself from himdoing so is much more difficult than maybe it soundsdo you have privacy in your house and can you spend more time in a selfcreated safe space than around your dadalso limit the amount of dialogue you have with him so you do not offer him a chance to feel invited to criticize youare there other people who live in the household w you and dadif yes then are they similarly called names or are you singled out by him what do the other family members do when they hear your dad calling you namesis it possible the other family members do not realize how hurt and upset you are by your dad's behaviorif yes then make a project for yourself to tell the other family members that you suffer from your dad's name callingit is possible the other family members will step in and tell your dad to stopnot necessarily that he will stop  knowing the others support you emotionally and find you credible is helpful on its own

698,what can i do about my family not accepting me as bisexual,hello and thank you for your question i am very sorry that this was your experience with your family i truly wish i could give you some things to say to them that would change their reaction but unfortunately i cannot do that their acceptance of you is a journey just like coming out is a journey for you sometimes families initially respond this way but after time they become more accepting and even supportive unfortunately there is no way to know for sure if that will happen so here are a few things i would suggestsurround yourself with people and things that remind you that you really are okay as you are that will not take the place of your family's acceptance and i will not even pretend that it would but it may help during those days when it hurts the most and that is really important patience is not something that many of us are really good at but this type of situation sometimes forces you to have some when families first learn something like this they may go through a period of shock and then sometimes even grieving they may even be worried if they are of a particular religion where being bisexual is forbidden these things can take time for them to reconcile so it may just take some patience if it is safe for you try to talk to them but if it becomes painful or hurtful then you have the right to walk away i do recommend setting up some personal boundaries for yourself and perhaps learn some assertiveness skills if you feel you struggle with them the reason i feel that this is important is that people sometimes take a lot of abuse from family members and friends in times like you are describing they may want to be accepted so much that they put themselves in hurtful positions over and over again hoping that their families will come around they may or they may not and if they do not you deserve to live a life free of abuse and to feel confident and assured of who you are to be surrounded by folks who remind you of that if you start seeing this pattern and you are struggling chatting with counselor may be a great idea i am bias probably but i think chatting with a counselor is always a good idea  hope this helps be well be you robin j landwehr dbh lpc ncc

710,what can i do when i feel like my life is out of control,when we feel overwhelmed by life situations it is important to understand where the feeling is coming from  once we understand the source it is important to normalize the situations that got us there and find balance in our livesfirst car accidents are common and since they are accidents they are not a reflection of us   when we have an accident we feel anxious worried and may have some trauma after the accidents  if you have been experiencing anxiety since the car accident talk to your doctor or therapist about it  second a lot of people fail classes tasks deadlines etc but they don’t give up on their goal  we have to remember that failing is part of the learning process and having the courage to try again is what gives us determination and character  remind yourself what motivated you to leave your job and the courage and determination that took to do so then channel that energy back into school  third when we have problems in our relationships is helpful to look for ways to improve communication discuss our concerns and how we want to resolve them but it may be that the relationship needs to end if there isn’t enough interest in one of the parts or if there’s verbal or emotional abuse  consider talking to your boyfriend and set some boundaries regarding appropriate communicationat all times  focus on being kind to yourself and improving your selfesteem increase selfcare activities do more things that you enjoy meditate in what gives you peace and make an effort to have more of that in your life   at the end you are the one in control of your life and you determine who you become¿qué puedo hacer cuando siento que mi vida está fuera de controlestuve en un accidente de auto y fue pérdida total  deje mi trabajo de 9 años para completar un grado a tiempo completo  falle una clase y mi novio piensa que soy estúpida el quiere dejarme  no tengo a donde ir y siento que lo estoy perdiendo todocuando nos sentimos agobiados es importante reconocer donde estamos parados y entender de donde vienen esas emociones  ya que entendemos la fuente de agobio es importante normalizar las situaciones que lo causaron y volver a encontrar el balance en nuestra vidaprimero los accidentes de auto son comunes y por ser accidentes no son un reflejo de nosotros o nuestras destrezas  cuando experimentamos accidentes no s sentimos ansiosos preocupados y puede que experimentemos algún trauma  si sientes ansiedad extrema preocupación habla con tu doctor o terapista al respecto  segundo muchas personas fallan clases tareas fechas de entrega pero no se rinden  tenemos que recordar que fallar es parte del proceso de aprendizaje y tener el valor de intentarlo de nuevo es lo que nos da determinación y carácter   recuerda que te impulsó a dejar tu trabajo y canaliza esa energía en la escuela  tercero  cuando tenemos problemas en las relaciones es importante comunicar nuestras preocupaciones y diferencias pero puede ser que la relación termine si no hay interés mutuo o si hay algún tipo de abuso   considera hablar con tu novio y establecer límites respecto a la comunicación apropiadaen todo momento enfócate en cuidarte a ti misma y mejorar tu autoestima aumenta las actividades que te ayudan a sentirte bien medita sobre lo que te paz y pasa más tiempo practicando esas actividades
711,what can i do when my family does not accept my sexuality,they would probably be helpful to speak with a local mental health professional about this not because there's anything wrong with the real you but because having these conversations can be difficult and you may choose to talk about your real self in different ways with different peoplemaybe you could talk about your concerns with your significant other and discuss different ways you may be able to discuss your relationship that fit with how each of you defines your love for one anotherbecause you are saying openly that you are gay and it sounds like you already identify yourself as gay as compared to considering being transgender soon it may be worth considering disclosing the fact that you are gay now and disclosing the idea that you are transgender after you have worked through that yourself i would like for you to be able to be true to yourself and show the real you it could also be that you already know that you are transgender but with the way that you  phrased it here i am not certainhere is a link to a hotline that you may want to consider using the trevor project is about helping teenagers who identify as lgbtq httpwwwthetrevorprojectorghere is another national site where you may be able to find a local chapter httpswwwpflagorgi do not know what you mean when you said that your family will not accept you but since you are concerned about your family's reaction i would suggest that it may be helpful to have a therapist or some other support in place before telling your family the decision of whether or not to wait longer to tell them is ultimately yours but i wonder if you have a likelihood of explaining what you are experiencing in a way that would be truer to you and also perhaps easier for your family to follow if you had time to process it with supportive people firstplease remember that you are not alone in this there are people in the world who can and will accept you for who you are
712,what can i do if there is no trust in our relationship,hi louisianayou say that the problems are with your past but my hunch is the problems are about his insecurity and his personal barriers to trust  you do not mention ever having hurt the trust in the relationshiptrust is the first stage in a relationship moving forward before they develop trust is a common mistake couples make and now you two have involved children in a relationship that is missing a crucial element but you did not see this coming did you that is because only as we become emotionally intimate do our deeper fears and insecurities come to the surface i give you credit for wanting it to work and i believe you would benefit from the support of a therapist in working through the kinks related to trust good luck
713,what do i do about a cousin who makes me feel belittled insecure and frustrated,do you have a close friend or relative who's opinion you trust ask them for their honest feedback and if they see you like your cousin does if they don’t see these qualities in you then it may be your cousin’s issue and she’s taking it out on you you can always ask her what would be the best way to communicate plans with her so you know specifically what she is expecting then if you meet these expectations and she still blames you and comments on how inconsiderate you are it is her issue and she is not coming from a place of loveeven if you do resemble her comments the way it sounds like she approaches this problem is not out of love the fact that you are introspective enough to consider your own behavior suggests the problem is not with you
714,what do i do if my 7 year old says she want to kill herself,you wrote a very full family context w many directions to examinedo you know or can you find out what the grandma and your daughter were doing in the evening of the screaming episodeis it possible the grandma abuses your daughter or tells her scary stories watches scary movies  these are only suggestions of some problem between grandma and your daughteralso ask your daughter directly why she wants to kill herself and what' killing herself means   seven year olds do not have a concept of death being a forever condition  seven year olds do not have a sense of future meaning besides likingdisliking them   maybe the new baby is a factor  do you feel this is a factor   trust your intuition to tell you if your daughter is resentful of your new babyeven if she is i doubt a seven year old has the capacity to connect current unhappiness with the intention of a future action including suicide
715,what do i do when i have anxiety attacks,this is a very common question in my practice panic attacks typically emerge from an underlying issue  to decrease your anxiety symptoms it’s recommended to seek treatment with a therapist who specializes in working with anxiety disorders and most importantly one with whom you feel comfortable within my practice i educate clients about their anxiety and discuss building a framework with helpful tools for decreasing anxiety1 starting a daily mindfulness practice for example listening to guided meditation engaging in deep breathing exercises yoga practice or other positive calming activities2 understand your negative and positive thoughts many times we tend to focus on the potential for bad things to happen increase positive selftalk when feeling down or when anxious for example i do not need to worry i am calm and relaxed 3 exposure to fearful or anxious situations this can be accomplished under the care of a mental health professional many times we shy away from things that make us feel uncomfortable or insecure this may led to an increase in isolating behaviors resulting in difficulty in performing things we were once able to do for example leaving the house presenting in front of others going to social events and having conversations with people however the more we expose ourselves and practice the use of our positive coping skills the chances of anxiety will decrease i hope this was helpful keep in mind a therapist can help with guiding you through self relaxation and improvement
716,what does it mean that i feel like different genders,hi as an affirming gender therapist i like to let people know that like sexuality gender is a spectrum too  it is possible to look like a girl and feel more like a boy just as it is possible to feel halfway between a boy and a girl or anywhere else on a horizontal line with two points between it  some people use different pronouns or words to express their gender and that is okay  it is up to you to find out what is most comfortable
717,what happens in a counseling session,hi  this is an excellent question    i think that the answer probably varies depending upon the particular therapist   in my work with people  once we have met and i have gotten an idea of the personga concerns and the issues they want help with  i spend the next few sessions gathering as much history and as much information about the client's current concerns in order to formulate some ideas about what may be causing distress   i would then share my thoughts with the client to see if they feel i am understanding them and on the right track  we would then discuss the best plan to address the client's concerns   usually i will suggest strategies that i think may be helpful and ask the client for feedback about whether or not they think my suggestions feel helpful    i always encourage clients to be really honest with me about this  i tell them that i would hate for them to agree to try things that they know they will not try just to avoid hurting my feelings or offending me  i want to be helpful and while i have the expertise as far as typically helpful  strategies i really like to work collaboratively and have clients tell me what they do and do not like  agree with or not agree with when i share my thoughts about a treatment plan   we the   work together to come up with a plan that will be helpful  but also realistic and then revise it and try new things if necessary as we go along   if things are not improving  i am very happy and willing to try something new  i hope this is helpful for you 
718,what is a psychotic seizure,i will admit that i am not specifically familiar with this from my own experiencemy best educated guess is that you could have a seizure during which you have some sort of symptoms similar to a hallucination when you hear or see things that are not really therein looking briefly online i was able to find some information here httpwwwepilepsycominformationprofessionalsaboutepilepsyseizurespsychiatricandbehavioralaspectspsychiatric2it sounds like this would be a symptom in addition to an already existing seizure disorder not a seizure disorder in addition to a mental health problem if it is the other way around i am not sure how that would work it is common with some types of seizures to have an altered state of reality during or shortly after the seizure so that could also be relatedi would suggest you talk to your physician about this directly so that if they are worried about this you can learn more about what is making them concerned about it and what if anything you could do to lessen the likelihood of it or how to handle it if it does happen
719,what is the best way to cope with the loss of someone to suicide,first of all i am very sorry for your loss and i can understand the urge to drink and smoke to try and cope as i am sure you understand alcohol and marijuana may take the edge off of the pain in the short run but in the long run they may prevent you from being able to work through the thoughts and feelings that you have about the loss of your friend grieving is a process that is unique to each individual and each relationship that may involve difficult confusing and even contradictory seeming thoughts and feelings and a competent therapist can help you work through this process it also may be useful for you to add other ways of coping such as taking care of yourself through exercise doing healthy activities that you love and spending time with people that you love self care is often most difficult when we need it the most thank you for reaching out
720,what makes a good marriage,this is a fantastic question in one sentence i would say the followingrecognize that while you and your partner probably have common interests and areas of commonality you are separate people each with different wants wishes and desires – if you consider a diagram of two overlapping circles they may share perhaps a third of the circle with overlap to indicate commonality and then there are parts of the circles that are not overlapping indicating separate interestsas for ways that may strengthen any relationship even the great ones this is what came to mind there are certainly more specific unique answers or elements for different people as far as the details but here are some general ideastry to have at least 15 minutes a week where you are spending time together and not problemsolvingrealize that listening to your partner does not mean that you are agreeing with them it just means that you are saying that you hear where they are coming fromlearn to hold on to your own wants wishes and desires while also recognizing those of your partnerset boundaries for what is and is not acceptable behavior during an argument or difficult discussiondiscuss how having important discussions can be anxietyproducing and consider having an understanding that if one of you feels overwhelmed you can take a timeout for a certain amount of time for example you may say okay i am feeling really stressed about this right now let's discuss it in an hour and at that time go back to the discussionconsider what your partner's top three or four complaints about you may be check in with them and see how accurate you are if you see validity in their responses consider whether or not you may want to make changesdiscover what makes your partner feel loved valued appreciated or specialrelationships are always in progress and constantly changing some anxiety around change is typical being able to effectively discuss the anxiety and actually listen to one another without being defensive name calling fingerpointing or asking each other to change is a true giftyou may enjoy this quote connection is the energy that is created between people when they feel seen heard and valued when they can give and receive without judgment brene brown
721,what makes my husband so selfish when it comes to my feelings,it sounds like there are issues with communication between you and your husband  your perceptions of interactions that you are having do not sound like they match up  it would probably be helpful for you both to work on communicating using i statements   this is a more effective way of communicating your needs than directly criticizing the other person  if you work on communicating in new less critical ways you both may learn more about your spouse's feelings and perspective
722,what should i do about my husband's emotional affair with his exwife,my answer is going to be super simplistic but i believe this may be what you need ask your husband if he wants to stay married to you  if he says yes then it would be helpful to go to a marriage counselor and work this out with a professional  if he says no then you can file for divorce
723,what should i do about my marriage and my wife's behavior,this has to be very confusingi wonder if the two of you would be able to have a conversation about what it is that she would like you to know about what happened yesterday and the day before so you know what message she wanted you to get out of all of thati would also recommend seeing a local mental health professional if you go yourself you could at least discuss your marriage and your own thoughts and feelings about it if you go together i would suggest you see a therapist who specializes in couples

726,what should i do after finding my boyfriend flirting on dating websites,i would suggest possibly talking about the type of relationship that both of you want to create for example you may want a relationship where honesty listening compassion and romanticism are major parts you could also see what your boyfriend wantsyou may also consider taking five minutes to see if he will listen to your feelings about him being on the dating site and whether he can work to learn more about what you are experiencing with asking openended questions and restating what you are saying to see if he has it right after that perhaps you could switch so that you can listen to his perspective for five minutes and learn more about what he is doing by asking openended questionsremember that it takes two people to have  a relationship so the choice is yours as to whether you choose to stay in the relationship and what kind of relationship you would like to have
727,what should i do if i found out one of my parents are cheating,you as the child in the middle of your parents' problems is the worse position to be in  i can only imagine your hurt pain and confusion on what to do  honestly this is a hard question to answer without knowing your age your parents' ability to handle hearing information from you and your maturity to handle what may happen in the end  one thing i would like to noteyour parents may be in the same house but if your mother is cheating they have already gone their separate ways
728,what should i do if i think my partner is cheating,hi texasoh that is a powerful idea is not it it burrows into your head let's figure this out first has your partner given you any concrete reason not to trust them have they cheated before if not then they deserve the benefit of the doubt until there is evidence if it is a yes then it is natural that these fears would be triggered and you can simply let your partner know what triggers the fear and what you need when you refuse to let me see your phone i worry that you are hiding something i need openness if they have not cheated on you in the past there are three possible scenarios here i invite you to take a moment and write down what the evidence is that cheating is going on what is the specific thing that is triggering your fears when you have your data recorded read onthe first scenario is that you have been personally hurt in the past by someone else and you have developed fears that you will be hurt again or that you are not enough to keep someone interested  this may be true if what you wrote down is they did not really do anything wrongthere is no evidence i am just scared and suspicious that is a cue to do some self reflection and calm yourself with thoughts like nothing has really happened i can trustif what you wrote down was vague evidence like for example your partner has been distant or irritable or you are having less sex than usual you can try to approach the situation without making assumptions trust your gut but your gut is not seeing evidence of cheatingit is evidence of something ask your partner what's up with accusations or assumptionsthe third possibility is that there is some clear evidence that they are cheating maybe there are texts on a phone or someone has told you something they saw i would say when there is some evidence it is okay to present this to your partner and ask what's going on if this happens repeatedly and your gut is screaming and there are only excuses or explanations that do not make sense then it is okay to do a bit of research and be extra aware of what's going on around you i hope that helps
729,what should i do if my boyfriend cannot get over my past,i am sorry to hear of your relationship struggles one thing i wonder is did you volunteer the information about your past or is this something that he asked about in the future it is probably best to leave details out of conversations like this i think it is common and natural for partners to ask about the sexual history for one thing it is a good idea to be checked for std’s before entering into a sexual relationship with someone and it is fair to share that information with each other partners usually want to know how many you have been with and what kind of sexual preferences you have or if there is anything you don’t like to do this gets into a gray area for some people i don’t necessarily want to know how many people my partner has been with and i certainly don’t want a whole lot of details sometimes that is an image i just don’t want in my head about my partner vague details are usually enoughhowever i understand that your partner has the details and is not happy with your past this is a reflection on him not you this shows insecurities on his part you cannot control how he will react to information that you provide to him and you cannot control how he feels about the information the past should remain in the past and not be held against you in the present or future if he cannot handle your past then it is going to cloud your relationship you can offer couples counseling to him and see if he will go with you i have seen relationships recover from some very serious problems such as infidelity it takes two people who both want it to work to make it work though if your boyfriend cannot get over your past you may have to let him go don’t keep yourself tied to someone who is not right for you constantly holding your past over your head and holding that against you is only going to bring you down and eventually you may start having insecurities or low selfesteem due to this type of treatment i don’t see that you have done anything wrong if you aren’t cheating on him now and you answered his questions about your past honestly how he handles that information is on him ultimately relationships have a tendency to come and go don’t fight to hold onto someone who is not right for you it is okay to be single and enjoy being the best you that you can be in time the right person for you will enter your life
730,what should i do when my parents will not let me see a therapist,the answer here really depends upon your age and something called the age of consent in the state where you live in pennsylvania anyone over the age of 14 can provide consent for their own treatment as for billing purposes try talking to some local agencies if you are under 18 you may be able to have medicaid out of medical necessity so that you can have treatment if you are over 18 there may be some discounted rates at some agencies because of the situation you are in maybe your primary care physician will be able to refer you to some local agenciesif you are in school you may be able to talk with a guidance counselor or someone at the school this would not require using your insurance
731,what should my boyfriend and i do to cope with his cancer,i wonder if both you and your boyfriend could have a conversation about what you both want wish for and desire from one another right now that does not necessarily mean that your partner will give everything that you ask for but this is one of the ways that he can learn more about what would help you through this and you can learn how you could support him since traditional medical treatment is not something he wantsyou may also consider using some openended questions to talk about what you are feeling about both about his cancer and about your relationship both of you may discuss different ways that you would like support from one anotheri would also see if he was comfortable with you disclosing this to one or a few of your close friends so that you both have support that includes each other and also includes others because there may be days when you both have a negatively emotional day at the same time and would benefit from talking with someone elseit may also be a matter of conversation to discuss what makes you happy together and use those positive moments to help move through more difficult ones
732,what's going on with these mood swings,why do you blame other people who had nothing to do with your actionsif it is because after the fact you wish you had accepted their help then the person who is responsible for this is yousince you are aware of your tendencies and how the interfere with your life try to become aware of when you do these habitsthis way you can interrupt your own patterns a little bit at a time
733,what's the best way to handle my spouse's narcissism and bipolar disorder,the behaviors you describe are boundary violations  you can not change your spouse but you can respond to his behaviors in ways that protect your boundaries and ensure your safety  this is very hard to do without support  finding a therapist who understands the dynamics of abusive relationships may be helpful  if you are not ready to do this i recommend the book boundaries by dr henry cloud and dr john townsend  it is a great resource for helping one recognize boundary violations and learning how to respond to them in ways that are constructive
734,what's wrong with me for going to summer school,there is nothing wrong with going to summer school
735,when i am around children i get this intense feeling of paranoia and fear,your question is written in a very sincere tone   this together with the fact of searching for selfunderstanding sound more like someone who is unsure and puzzled not someone who is badwhat was your own childhood likethe sensations you describe feeling sometimes occur in people who are reminded of very deep hurts from during their own childhoodis it possible what you are feeling is from being reminded of great distress you lived through when you were at a similar age as the kids around whom you feel this sudden and great paranoia and fear
736,when should i give up on a relationship,there are plenty of red flags that you have been presented withseveral breakups not holding up his end of the bargain regarding worklack of empathy for your miscarriagelying about his involvement with another womanphysical violence which is of most concern this seems to be a very unhealthy relationship in my experience relationships such as these rarely become positive ones violence is never okay and regardless of his reasoning  it is indefensible you have to look at these red flags and ask yourself “is this really someone i want to marry is he an asset to my life” i think you’ll realize he is notbest of luck to you and please know that you deserve someone who treats you with kindness dignity and respect
737,where does a child go for help,i think it would be wise for you to call a hotline especially designed for children it is called the childhelp national child abuse hotline the number is 18004achild  it is completely anonymous and a trained therapist will be able to provide you with guidance confidentiality and can also help you make a report of you wantthe call is completely free and they are open 24 hours a day  7 days a week i am glad that you are taking steps to improve your situation you are a very brave and an intelligent child please remember to call 911 if you are in immediate danger
738,why am i all of a sudden having issues communicating with the guy i’m dating,sounds like you are struggling with your own negative thoughts  as you stated everything was great then you started having low selfesteem thoughts and thinking  what is contributing to these negative thoughts  his actions or your past experiences with unhealthy relationships would be my question
739,why am i constantly angry,hi nashville i am glad you want this to be different it does not feel good to be angry all the time and it is stealing your energy as well as affecting relationships i am sureworking with a therapist you can learn to recognise the deep emotions that lie underneath the anger it is likely to be either powerlessness or worthlessness and what happens is this a small moment in the present touches on an old tender bruised emotion that we have simply felt too much of or too strongly in the past we develop ways of avoiding these vulnerable emotions and anger is one way of doing that so when someone looks at you in a certain way or says something you would rather be angry than feel powerless or unimportant  in that moment your instinct is to blame whatever happened no matter how small because that is the thing that happened just before you got mad you fail to recognise that the problem is not the look on that persongs face or the shoe that someone left in front of the doorit is that you cannot stand feeling something and you want to avoid it like you want to stamp your foot out if it is on firei suggest finding a therapist to work with you can learn to take responsibility for your old emotions and find new ways to manage them 
740,why am i dreaming so much,perhaps more dreaming means that you are making use of your mind to solve problems  i find that change states while sometimes difficult are very exciting  they give you opportunity to grow more rapidly  so i say congratulations  mark 
741,why am i experiencing dfficulty maintaining an erection,for starters know that this is a normal experience for many men at some point in their lives while this can certainly cause some embarrassment a diminished sexual esteem or relationship problems it is important to know you are not alone i am going to move forward assuming that you have already checked with a medical professional to rule out any medical problems that may be related to this assuming that is the case for most this happens for two primary reasons it is either a short term biological shortage of blood flow to the penis this can be caused my diet lack of exercise even stress another primary reason for loss of erections are anxiety have their been recent relationship issues are you feeling as though you are not satisfied in the bedroom these are just a few aspects that can cause subconscious anxiety and loss of erection my suggestion to you would be to seek out a counselor that specializes in sexuality that can assist you in moving forward with this  best of luck
742,why am i not as comfortable around my boyfriend anymore,hi new jerseyyou talk about two very big changes in your life that have happened lately the diagnosisanxiety and the moving in together that is a loti love how you recognise that you been 'questioning everything' i think anxiety's got its toe in the door and it is pushing you around wanting some power over you fear and anxiety try to convince us that we need protection and that it is best to either pull away or fight but letting anxiety control how you see your relationship is not the answer here i think you know that alreadyyou must have moved in with him for a reason and it is appropriate now to simply trust that to ask him for some patience and to focus on learning to manage the anxiety rather than questioning this decision to move in fear is getting in the way of you trusting yourself and your decision you can figure the anxiety piece out while living with your boyfriendwhen you are in a bit of a crisis is not the right time to make a major change i suggest you use a therapist who works with cognitive behavioural therapy to learn to manage the anxiety and then the relationship will likely seem more clear
743,why am i scared to touch a girl,your question is a good onethe best way to decrease the fear would be to talk with your fiancee about it   eventually she will find out and better to talk about it when there is less pressure than to be in the midst of a situation which frightens youalso she may feel similar to you who knowsdiscussing a topic which relates directly to your relationship is a good way to increase emotional intimacy  and emotional intimacy has a lot to do with feeling at ease with physical intimacy
744,why am i sick to my stomach when i stand up,hello and thank you for your question you may be right your physical symptoms of getting sick to your stomach may very well be your nerves or anxiety that is totally normal and understandable given your circumstances another thing that is not unusual is that you feel better when you sit and rock that is actually a fairly common way that many people comfort themselves in times of high stress if you are concerned that there is an actual physical illness causing these symptoms you may want to visit your primary care provider they may tell you that they do not see anything physically wrong with you and at that point you may want to visit a counselor about the symptoms and your relationship experience a visit with a counselor may be a good idea either way i work as a counselor in primary care and i promise you that many people have very real physical symptoms when they have gone through abuse unexplainable stomach and headaches are very common sometimes with counseling those physical symptoms actually stop be well and i hope you feel better soonrobin j landwehr dbh lpcc ncc
745,why am i so angry and jealous,in case knowing this helps you there are many more people in similar circumstance as you than you may realizesimilar to you they are not on fb for the reasons you list  plus no one wants to go on fb and tell the world they do not have a fantastic life  everyone on fb is happy even when they are miserable they are happy telling everyone about itfirst yes it is painful to see all around you what appears as joyful living  please keep in mind that the life you imagine these people have is not necessarily the true life they are having  i have been a therapist for a long time and have seen repeatedly how people who are married with kids by age 30 start having problems by their midthirtiessecond respect your unique identity  for whatever reason you have more sensitivity possibly more depth more complex standards and expectations of yourself and othersas hard as it may sound or actually be take time to hear your intuition and what it tells you you need for your own growth and developmentfeeling embarrassed can also be turned into a positive  consider it as motivation for the long term to develop new ways of reaching your goalsi hope this helps
746,why am i so anxious in social situations,"basically your response is the fight flight or freeze reaction
which is hard wired into the human nervous system specifically the autonomic nervous system   this system
is responsible for regulating the heart digestion respiratory rate
as well as other aspects which match the symptoms you describe  it is largely an unconscious function but
with training it can be managed such as a public speaking course in which you
prepare and even have some exposure to smaller experiences to help you prepare
and cope for larger presentations  one of the greatest applications of
addressing this response is the nasa program which exposes the astronauts to situations
they will encounter while in space which will trigger the response so that when
it does happen that they are able to move through the
challenge with success  you can learn
more about his by going to ted talks “what i learned about going blind in space” it is
a truly inspiring look at what you are experiencing as well as how to deal with
it 
with that being said finding a program
like a dale carnegie public speaking program can help  working with a counselor who can help you
utilize visualization of an upcoming speech has been shown to help and you can
always talk to your doctor to see what options might be available there as
well good luck"
747,why am i so mad,knowing how you feel and also being able to stabilize yourself to act upon the tremendous anger you feel are fine qualitiesanger whatever the magnitude generally reflects emotional pain that has not yet been placed into wordstry thinking over your growing up years because maybe you will discover certain repeated dynamics which upset you and that no one helped you feel secure through such timesalso if either of your parents drank too much and raged when they were drunk you may be repeating their patterns of how to respond to situations   even without drinking the response patterns of yelling and throwing things are frightening enough to leave a permanent memoryif this describes part of your childhood then it is possible you are becoming angry because it was the only emotion that either of your parents was able to express
748,why am i so nervous talking to people,hi i am glad you wrote because i think a lot of people have this same issue and we do not talk about it much you have some social anxiety that is a bit beyond what the average person might feel most people have some amount of worry about what others might think of them and this probably prevents us from making complete fools of ourselves so that is a good thing but your alarm system is out of whack and you are spending too much time worrying about how you come across as you age you understand this more and it is truethat other people really are not thinking about you much or monitoring you at all they are too busy having the same thoughts you are having am i good enough do people like me judge methink i am weird we are all concerned about how we come across far more than how others come across like many people you lack compassion for yourself acceptance of yourself and confidence in yourself my gut says that these things came from somewhere in your past our sensitivities usually come from a specific time in our life when we experienced or felt something that was overwhelming and we end up with an alarm system that overreacts at times without more details it is difficult to go further here i recommend you see a therapist who does cognitive behavioural therapy which can help you understand the roots of your fears and learn how to manage them more successfully
749,why am i so protective of my friends and family,you could be protective because of things that happened in your past or in the past of the people that you are protecting a lot of us have natural instincts that we do not want other people to be in pain for other people conflict is just hard to watch andor listen toas for having a tough time trusting them that could also relate to past events between you and these other people or it could relate to the conflict that you mentioned it can be difficult to trust someone deeply when you do not know when the next big fight or argument is going to startthe next time you step in for someone consider asking yourself what is making you do that what are you feeling in the moment
750,why am i so sad,i wonder if you have moments where you feel happyyou say you have amazing friends i wonder if you get along with them and feel as though you can be yourself around themsometimes we put a lot of pressure on ourselves to do really well at everything all the time and this can be overwhelming sometimes where do you have support i hope you can tell someone that you are feeling sad so that you can talk about your feelingssleeping can make a big difference as far as feeling sad as well if you are not sleeping well at night that could be a big part of feeling sad a lotperhaps you could try to find a person or two who makes you feel totally safe and comfortable and try to talk with them
751,why am i starting to not like myself,check out my latest blog on  fourwaysaddselfesteemfriendslisti hope this provides a few nuggets of helpfulness to you
752,why am i upset or down every day even when nothing is going on,one thing that comes to mind is making a list of some things that happen each day it could be that there are things that are affecting how upset you are but because so many other things are going on you may not noticeanother idea to try is to keep a list for a month of one good thing that happened each day this way when you are having a rough day you have a list to think of and take a look atare you eating and sleeping in ways that are typical for you  these two ideas are closely related to changes in your moodfrom where do you have support friends or familycan you take 5 or 10 minutes per day to do something that you enjoyif you think back to the last time that you felt content what was contributing to thatanother possibility is to try to be mindful of things that you do every day for example rather than eating a turkey sandwich as fast as possible on your lunch break consider actually tasting it and enjoying it also consider giving yourself praise for doing something well for example when you finish your paperwork take a moment to notice that and maybe reward yourself by checking your email reading five pages of a book or something else that can be done quickly before you get back to your next task
753,why am i with my husband if he is mean,what you are describing is a state of abandonment like no other a direct lack of respect the challenge here is you cannot control another person no matter how hard you try the only person that you have control of is yourself so then the question that this reality poses is what are you willing to change if you love yourself and know that you have tremendous value if you can see what you bring to a relationship and that you deserve respect and love and tenderness then you will get to a point where you will settle for nothing less than that the change that might be necessary in yourself is to change the way you see yourself the way you treat yourself and what you accept your husband also needs to change and that is something only he can do for himself but reaching out to get help as well it would be helpful for you both to get help because there is damage on both parts you have much more power than you realize and talking with someone can help you to hone that power and make a difference in your own life sometimes the differencechange can be walking away from a bad situation or it can simply be changing your attitude and raising the bar sometimes our loved ones come with us on the elevation and sometimes they get left behind  you must do some deep introspection through therapy to get to the point where you can answer this question for yourself
754,why cannot i change,hello and thank you for your question changing unwanted behavior is one of the hardest things a person can do i agree with sherry that being patient with yourself is important here are a few things i would suggest1 get clear on the behaviors you really want to change and make sure they are behaviors that can be changed sometimes we will set a goal like i want to be more confident but that is hard to measure and prove to yourself that you accomplished it saying you are going to accept a date or go on a job interview is something you can actually do and something that you may consider to be demonstrating confidence whatever your change of behavior is make sure it is something you can actually change 2 if you are going to give up a behavior decide what you are going to do in place of it so if you are going to stop showing up late for work then you are deciding to be on time for work and demonstrating your value of being punctual 3 if you are going to make changes really nail down why you want to make them what is it about making these changes that is important to you as a person for example if you have the goal of weight loss the reason this is important to you as a person may be because you value selfcare knowing why you want to make changes is both your motivation and your compass for getting there 4 once you know why you want to make these changes i strongly suggest setting small goals if you set too high of goals you may not accomplish them and just feel worse so make the goal small realistic and guided by the the things you want to be as a person 5 as sherry mentioned finding a counselor is sometimes a good idea if you really feel stuck any counselor who does work with goalsetting and motivation can probably help be wellrobin landwehr dbh lpcc
755,why cannot i get an erection with my girlfriend,i am sorry to hear of your problemfirst step as always when a possible medical explanation exists go for a urology check up to either your internist or a urologistonce you know there is no medical reason which would prevent an erection then we can consider the psychological and emotion based factorsmaybe you are nervous about your sexual performance or that your gf may be disappointed in your performancemen often mistake their own fears of performance failure with the assumption that their partner thinks about sex as a performancetalk with your gf about whatever is on your mind which may inhibit you from enjoying sexthe reasons are endlesswhat matters is to have a heartfelt dialogue with each otherthe emotional support which comes through such an intimate conversation may very well be the catalyst for a more relaxed and satisfying approach to sex w your gf
756,why cannot i laugh anymore,if you look back to when you feel as though you were the funny guy i wonder what is different now it may be that responsibilities have changed or any number of other thingsi do not know whether you are also saying that you feel sad or if you are saying that you feel as though you do not have any big changes in your feelingsa lot of us tend to be really busy and sometimes we over schedule ourselves to the point that we do not have time to have positive time for ourselves sometimes even if we are spending time with friends we are thinking about work and all of the other things we need to doi wonder if it feels awkward when you are with friends that you trust in an environment that you are used to maybe if that is more comfortable for you it can be a stepping stone to focusing on how you feel better in those momentsit sounds as if you may have had an experience where you felt misunderstood or criticized and now reacting to people feels awkward if so try going back to people you trust who do you have support from
757,why cannot i let myself trust my partner,two paths are possibleyou are not overreacting and instead are genuinely sensing that something feels unsettled within your girlfriendyou are overreacting because you have difficulty accepting how safe and loving your relationship is with this personthe only way to find out is to start conversations with your girlfriend on how you feelthis will allow new light to open an answer as to the truthonce you know what truly is going on between the two of you your selftrust naturally will grow stronger selftrust will give you an accurate read of what and whom you are able to safely trust
758,why cannot i stop crying,because you are sad and miss the relationship you had w grandma and your brotherthe academic point that grief takes a different length of time to lift for each person is truealso from a spiritual perspective your grandma and brother are still here in loving relation to you just not in physical body  pay attention if you have a sense of talking to them within your mind  this may lessen your feeling of losswhen you are done crying about missing them your grief will simply disappear on its own  it cannot be forced to leave
759,why cannot i stop these thoughts,i think we all go through a period of time where we think we are not worth anything sometimes these feelings are a result of low self esteem or because of shame the most important part of dealing with this thought is to separate feelings from reality i do not feel worth anything but i know what i do is important i know who i am matters to others i know i am loved and cared aboutwhen you find yourself having these thoughts stop take a few deep breaths and try to reframe what you are thinking
760,why cannot my mom ever be proud of me,i imagine this is very difficult and confusing for youit sounds like there are things for which you are proud of yourself which is really good i hope there are also other people in your life that are currently able to recognize the good things that you are doingif you think your mom would be willing to go to see a local mental health professional with you that may be a good place to have some discussions about the relationship that the two of you have the reason i am suggesting that it may be easier to have the conversations there is because sometimes the mental health professional can point out parts of conflict that are not easy for the people who are involved to actually see by themselvesif you want to try to talk with you mom to see how she is feeling maybe she would be willing to discuss it with you if you are going to have a conversation like that i would suggest you try these thingsask her if this would be a good time to have an important conversation if she says no consider asking her when would be a better timetry to have the conversation with the goal of taking about five minutes to learn more about where she is coming from on this if you can ask questions to learn more about that you may be able to know more about what she is thinking and feelingthis does not mean that you have to agree with her but just that you are able to hear where she is coming fromtry to ask questions that start with the words who what how where when questions that start with the word why can be difficult to answer and can lead to a lot of extra emotiontry to summarize what she is saying to see if you have it rightif you want your mom to know how you feel after you can listen to what she is saying and see if she is willing to listen to what you would like to sayif you are going to tell your mom about how you feel consider having some points written down ahead of time so you can explain yourself the way that you want toit will probably be really hard to listen to her without being defensive right away i know i would be wanting to jump right into the conversation remember that jumping in right away will probably make it more difficult to learn where your mom is coming fromalso if she says she does not want to have a conversation remember that she has that choiceif your mom does not want to go to see a counselor with you remember that you could go on your own depending on your state and exactly how old you are you may need your parent's permission to be in treatment but not always if you need help to figure that out try contacting a couple of local mental health agencies to see if they can help you figure out what to do if you want to talk to someone
761,why did my boyfriend hit himself in the face during an argument,sounds scary to watch  i agree with youmaybe he felt so overwhelmed by anger hurt and frustration that he went back to an old behavior from his past in which someone hit him for having strong emotionsnow that the incident is past bring up the topic to him so the two of you can discuss itjust the fact of you having empathy and caring what he was feeling at the time may be restorative to himat the very least you may find out exactly what the answer is to your question as to why he did this in the first place
762,why did my sister not defend me when my exhusband said bad things about me,sorry for so much emotional pain from the combination of the divorce and your sister not supporting you in the way you wishwhen you feel ready and if you feel this would help then consider to talk to your sister from perspective to improve the relationship the two of you havesince the ex is gone and the sister is an ongoing person in your life this particular incident is only one in many which the two of you will have with each otherthe disappointment you feel now as to how she handled herself is a point to bring up to her for the sake of clarifying the type of relationship you each would like to build with each otheras to your specific question as to why she did what she did she is the only person who has the answerstart with finding out if she wants to improve the relationship altogether   then you can use her lack of support with the ex as an example of how meaningful her support of you is to you
763,why do i always feel anxious,being able to know you feel anxiety and write about it is the first step to addressing and handling itgenerally anxiety is deep fear of not being able to handle what comes up in life  somehow the person was insufficiently nurtured and so felt  insecure when very youngusually the person had to fend on at least a psychological and emotional level for themselves before reaching an age when doing so would have been reasonabletheir inner feeling of overwhelmed from when very young has not faced the reality that the grown person is now capable even if this takes some practice try asking yourself what you are afraid of and theorize how you would handle these situations as a grown personalso sometimes anxiety comes from feeling lonely  this loneliness is reminiscent of the loneliness that the grown person now felt when being left to take care of situations as a child which were too difficult and complex for any child to address
764,why do i always feel like i am being watched,it sounds like you are feeling pretty overwhelmed with worry about being continuously monitored with no privacy even in your own mind and as if people are constantly saying things about you in whispers on in the media it is hard to say from a post online what is at the root of this experience but you may be able to get insight into that as well as develop ways of coping with the distress of feeling this way with the help of a good therapist there is no pill or technique that can guarantee that this experience will go away though it might however there are things that you can do so that you can understand it better and so that it does not have such an impact on your ability to lead a satisfy life
765,why do i always get ignored by people,i am sorry that you are having a difficult timei wonder about how your friendships are in person if you get along well with people and have effective conversations with them facetoface there could be some kind of technologyrelated problemhave you tried gently talking to people about how you send a message and they did not answer if you can phrase it in such a way that they recognize that you are asking for information and not blaming them for not answering you that could be effectivei would also encourage you to consider how much this is bothering you if it is causing a significant amount of anxiety  i would suggest talking with a local therapistin the meantime consider talking about this with someone you trust to whom you can get more details to get a more specific answer
766,why do i always push my boyfriend away,there could be many reasons that you push your boyfriend away it could be part of how you were raised it could be because of culture it could even be your own insecurities about yourself that are then outwardly manifested in you pushing him away what is important in all this is that you both find a way to connect so what if you are not a hugger a kisser or a toucher you have to find what works for the both of you and your relationship there are many ways to show affection that are not physical  if your boyfriend wants the physical attention then work on ways that are comfortable for the both of you making sure to start out slow and to work your way up to more physical touching
767,why do i always think my girl is cheating on me,i wonder if you are having some of these thoughts related to something that has neither happened directly to you in your past or to someone that you care about this can often change the way that we look at different situations try to look at what feelings for you when you notice that someone is checking her out and perhaps when you have felt these feelings beforeif you trust your girl enough to have an open conversation perhaps you could ask her whether she is willing to talk about something that is important to you then you could talk about feelings that you are having
768,why do i crave depression,it sounds like you are noticing that you are drawn towards sad and negative content and it is hard to understand why this may sound counterintuitive but sometimes we do things that on the surface may look problematic because it serves us in some unseen way a simple example would be somebody who is addicted to a substance their addiction may be causing serious problems in their life and they may even know it but the addiction serves them by helping them to avoid painful feelings that they anticipate having if they quit using now i am not saying that what you describe is an addiction it is just a really illustrative example of the unseen benefitone thing i would be wondering about is what is the unseen benefit of seeking out sad and negative content i would also be wondering what your relationship is to other feelings these are things you may benefit from exploring with a competent therapist

770,why do i feel like i always need to be in a relationship,there could be many reasons but often people feel validated when they are in a relationship the need to be in a relationship can be related to a belief of unlovability which often stems from our childhood the relationship sort of soothes this temporarily and the others interest or desire helps counteract the ingrained belief there are many questions that may help understand why how was your relationship with your mother   how was your childhood etc many people describe having a hole or void they try and fill with material things or people but it only is a temporary fix which usually drives the person to the next relationship or object in hopes it will be fulfilling but it never is because fulfillment is work we need to do ourselves this journey involves finding acceptance and love for ourselves once we have that we do not need to look elsewhere for fulfillment
771,why do i feel like i can never meet people's expectations,it sounds like you have the perception that people are frequently disappointed in you wish you were different or someone else and ultimately reject you one question i would have for you is what is your evidence that people feel this way is there anything in people's words or behaviors that gives you this impression if your not sure it may be useful for you to try to notice what people say and do in response to you even though you perceive these attitudes within them additionally working with a competent therapist may be a great way to get an answer to your question as well as developing ways to move forward with that answer and gain a sense of selfesteem and security in your relationshipsone possibility that comes to mind of which there may be more is that as we grow up we often develop relational templates or sets of expectations about how people are and will relate to us which influence our experiences and behavior in relationships sometimes the templates that we develop to stay connected growing up are not particularly adaptive for adult life and can hamper our selfesteem and capacity for comfortable intimacy as an adult you ask a great question here and one that can be very hard to see through given the difficulty of feeling that people think of you in this way and i hope that you will stay curious about this and consider working with a therapist who is trained to help you discover the answer
772,why do i feel like i do not belong anywhere,for some people having a sense of belonging takes some timeyou mentioned that you have an education and some basic daily needs i wonder if you may be able to look at your relationship with yourself and what makes you feel happy safe and having a sense of accomplishment if you have those feelings i wonder how you define trust and who you trustyou say you have a good time with people who are supposed to be close so i wonder what keeps them from feeling close i have also wondering if you have been emotionally hurt in the past and if so you may have some protective defenses that you use to protect yourself from being hurt again remember that this idea comes in degrees where you can be more perfect in certain situations and a little less in others being emotionally protected is on a spectrum or continuum where you can make an infinite amount of adjustments or changes with different people and situationsi also wonder what it is that you want in your home and how you define it consider giving yourself permission to think about how you would define your perfect home in a world where there were no realistic restrictions  after you have that consider what parts of that you can have perhaps there is a small part that you could make a reality within a week or sothank you for reaching out if this continues to be difficult for you consider seeing a local mental health professional so you can discuss some more specific details
773,why do i feel like i need a man in my life,what a wonderful questiongood for you on clearly knowing your prioritiesif i was sitting with you now i would ask you to list your reasonsstart with whatever answers you do come up with and examine each of these a little furtherif for example you feel you need a man because many of your friends are in relationships then possibly you feel insecure about being your unique self even when this sets you apart from your friendsif you feel you need a man to protect you financially then possibly you have lost faith in your ability to financially support yourselfif you would like a man in your life to offer your love and are willing to contribute the work of relating intimately then you have found the best reason for wanting a man in your lifethis is far different than need
774,why do i feel like i will never have a good careeramount to anything financially,for starters commend yourself for being committed to working you have no idea what is going to happen in the next second so focusing on thinking you will never have a good career or amount to anything financially is creating a fictitious story  remind yourself of that every time the thought pops up  the false belief that nothing good will happen is sucking out energy you can use on pursuing your career dreams next do you know what you need to do to become an electrician or heavy machinery operator if not find out then set up a realistic schedule for yourself to accomplish the steps as you accomplish each step see your progress  notice that you are moving closer to your goal  every day remind yourself why you are pursuing this career  in fact write it down and tape it on your bathroom mirror  when you start to feel discouraged remember your goal and remind yourself that you have no idea if you will make it or not but you are going to give it everything you have to find out anything worth pursuing is going to take a lot of persistence and hard work stay with it you and your family are worth it
775,why do i feel like i am always wrong in everything in my relationship,hello that must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault this could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the longterm based on what you are reporting and without knowing your wife's side of the story i would say that you are raising 3 different concerns one is that there seems to be some concern of infidelity from your wife that you feel is not justified it may bear clarifying how each of you define infidelity currently there is no uniform definition of infidelity because it can emcompass a hookup chatroom texting extensive phone calls to a female friend viewing pornography a massage with happy ending physical intercourse or intimate emotional sharing depending on whether any of these circumstances have occured you may need to reflect whether there is any truth to what she may be accusing you of and for you to share with her your reasons for engaging in these activities if there is no truth to it then my clinical intuition is that she may be accusing you of infidelity as a way of saying i feel you distancing from me in other words it is not so much about whether you are actually unfaithful but a statement of how she feels as she witnesses your distancing from her often times accusing a partner of cheating is likened to a cry or a yearning for closeness if so what you want to do is to reflect to her that perhaps she is saying that you are unfaithful because she senses that you are moving away from her emotionally if this is true you may wish to share with her why you are pulling away and then discuss the kind of support you may need to feel closer to her again otherwise if the focus becomes about who is right and who is wrong the conversation will never touch at both of your core emotional needs the second issue touches upon how to interpret calling someone a sweetheart the term has been loosely used in a variety of contexts to mean you are so sweet and kind my dear or in a flirtatious manner to mean sweetie the intention behind the use is known only to the speaker you may want to reflect in what context you meant to use the term and share it with your wife if your wife overheard the comment not knowing your intentions or context it is possible that she may have misinterpreted what you have said  if she finds the term disrespectful it may be her way of expressing i want to be the important person in your life and if you call someone else a sweetheart it means that i am not valued as much therefore arguing about who has the right or wrong interpretation may be missing the mark rather the issue is about how do you wish to treat or show consideration of each others feelings you may wish to explore how do you show her that you value her and that she is important to you is saying sweetheart to another woman conducive to that or is it sending mixed messages to your wife that said if you have expressed and shown her that she is important to you on many occasions with open discussions and by understanding accomodating and prioritizing her needs then her actions may be a reflection of her personal insecurities she may need to speak to a therapist about her feelings and her fearsthe last issue you raised concerns your wife never admitting she is wrong indeed that must be frustrating for you to hear often that you are doing something wrong in the absence of her admitting to any faults it could seem like you are the one with the problem unfortunately blaming invites defensiveness and a withdrawn behavior because most people who feel blamed do not feel good about themselves and wishes to distance themselves from the person who is making them feel unhappy this pattern can also trigger the partners' insecurity as they witnesses the distancing which could make them angrier and more accusatory  creating a vicious cycle finding a healthy way of reaching out when your partner is in turmoil to help calm her emotions and being able to speak about your own feelings and needs is at the heart of a very secure attachment this kind of conversation can be guided by an experienced professional to help both of you to express your feelings and needs in a safe and secure way to foster a secure bonding we sometimes take for granted the simple expression of i am sorry however it requires a certain comfort with being vulnerable to express that in my practice when a client tells me that his or her partner never says i am sorry i am often observing the first partner to see if they are able to express vulnerability if neither of them express it then it makes sense to me because why would one risk being vulnerable and then getting hurt if they open up if the other partner does not do it these insights in therapy can sometimes lead to a different relationship building conversation which can help couples to to feel safer with each other rather than blaming and alientating for more information about these services you are welcome to read my

781,why do i feel so lonely when i have friends and attention,this may be happening because you and the others are not connected to each other on a level which reaches your emotionsloneliness may show the absence of feeling a variety of emotions when you are among othershow many friends you have does not affect whether you and someone else feel emotionally engaged with one anotherconsider if you feel like concentrating your friendship on more intensively sharing your feelings with a few of your friendsthis may lead to fewer friends who are also more meaningful to you and your feeling a decrease of loneliness
782,why do i feel worthless and tired,you are describing some of the most common symptoms of depression low self esteem difficulty sleeping changes in appetite sad mood feelings of hopeless and feelings of worthlessness a full assessmentevaluation with a mental health professional is warranted to understand if indeed you meet criteria for a major depressive disorder ie are delressed one thing i often tell patients is that do you think you are depressed people often answer yes or no but many individuals respond with a question how would i know to that i often explain that if i stopped watching movies or better stopped enjoying watching movies that would be a clear indication for me that i am delressed it would be a sign that i have lost pleasure or interest in the activity that i typically enjoy most  i will ask you to think of one activity which you really really enjoy  it could be anything from reading to being with friends to skiing to watching tv  i would like to now ask you if you have stopped enjoying that activity or cannot find the motivation to engage in it this is another symptom of depression loss in pleasurable activities the good news is that there are many effective available treatment if you are indeed in a depression or simply you want to modifydecrease your depressive symptoms ie you want to stop feeling so tired and so worthless treatment includes one or more of the following psychotherapy medication exercise any one or combination of both of these can help to improve your mood the even better news is that feeling that you are doing something wrong can diminish with appropriate treatment over time  i hope you find this information helpful the most important next step is to get evaluated by a mental health professional typically a psychologist or psychiatrist and for both you and the professional to better understand your symptoms and your mood in the context of what is going on in your life
783,why do i find pleasure in thinking about killing,maybe because you have great emotional pain stored inside you of which you are not aware existssometimes people who feel greatly hurt by others or who feel unloved by others imagine if they do the opposite of love which is to kill that they will get the recognition and acknowledgement from others which they wish would come to them in a loving waythis is my theory it is not necessarily a definitive description of your inner dynamicmost important is to keep an open mind to selfdiscovery on your feelings including the ones which are uneasy such as killing to consider
784,why do i get a weird feeling every few months or so,i am not entirely sure whether this relates to something in the mental health realm or if there is something else happening i know you said that your doctor said it is not related to your physical condition but have you tried speaking with your primary care physician i have seen people with many different symptoms that end up being related to acid reflux or something of that nature as far as the out of body experience there are different stages of sleep so if this is happening in the middle of the night and you are waking up from a dream you may not be fully awake when it is going on these are just some thoughts but i think talking to your primary care physician would be a great place to start
785,why do i get angry so easily,i do not like the word problem  it is such a strong word  however i would say that you have an issue that needs to be addressed and controlled before it directed at the wrong person and gets totally out of control  i have found that anger management classes has been helpful for my clients  try and see if it will help  you will be surprised at what you learn about your self
786,why do i get aroused when women call me gay,maybe it is a way to secretly satisfy your own wish to be or to live life gay
787,why do i get random spurts of anger over petty things,hi i am glad you wrote in general when a small thing bothers us  it is because the small thing triggers an emotion in us that we have felt too much or too intensely in the past and we do not know how to manage that emotion effectivelywe just want to avoid it as quickly as possible cognitive behavioural therapy with a qualified therapist can help you to understand what is being triggered in you and learn how to manage emotions productively you say that your behaviours are self destructive and i agree it sounds like you have developed a habit of channelling your distress towards selfharm and this is a separate and potentially more serious problem this is a choice you make that points to shame being an issue for you again a good therapist can help you learn what's behind your shame and selfharm your feelings are normal and you can learn more healthy ways to deal with them with qualified help
788,why do i hate sex,although i am not entirely sure why you might be struggling in this area an initial question i have is do you want to be sexually active at this time or is this something that you feel pressured into doing  if you feel pressured into being sexually active by your friends or boyfriend it is understandable that you want it to be over  i would encourage you to ask your boyfriend to be patient with you at this time  until you figure out what is going on  i encourage you to then think very deeply about what your reservations if any  about being sexually active  do you fear pregnancy  are there problems in the relationship  are you afraid of the emotional intimacy another question that comes to mind is whether or not you have any history of sexual activity that you did not consent to that might be getting in the way   when these types of traumatic events occur  people can essentially become triggered negatively by anything that reminds them of past trauma  such events can cause an aversion to sex even if there is now a loving relationship whom one wants to be sexually active with  if this is the case i strongly recommend individual therapy to begin working through some of these issues a final area that you might explore would be whether or not you are experiencing pain with penetration  if so i would recommend that you schedule an appointment with a gynecologist to rule out any type of medical issues that might be causing these problems  although pain can also be associated with emotional issues it is always good to rule out possible physical causes  i hope that these ideas help to point you in the right direction  take care
789,why do i have low selfesteem and lack confidence,check out my latest blog on  fourwaysaddselfesteemfriendslisti hope this offers you some nuggets of helpfulness
790,why do i keep getting with men that emotionally abuse me,i want to applaud you for taking this first step towards realizing that this is an issue and wanting to do something about it  you are already on the road to a happier life with this realization  a lot of women do not recognize that it may be something about them that continues to attract a man like this and will only blame it on the men for treating them that way  until you realize there is a problem you won’t start looking for a solutiondon’t misunderstand me  the abuse is not your fault you are seeing a pattern though so this does need to be addressed first go and buy the book “boundaries where you end and i begin” by anne katherine  read it  this book describes many situations that are similar to yours describes how a person came to be that way and how to stop it  you will have to learn to set good boundaries in your life and to maintain thembe single for a while  stay single until you feel like a whole healthy happy person on your own  often we get in a relationship because of a need  if you feel like you need a person in your life to make you a whole person then you are in a relationship for the wrong reasons  the first step is to work on whatever it is in you that makes you feel like you need another person in your life  identify those needs and then learn to fulfill them on your owni was doing a couples therapy session and the husband was being emotionally abusive to the wife  this was a recurrent theme for her like you are saying it is for you  however she had been doing a lot of work on her own and in private therapy and this was a new relationship  obviously she still had not “gotten it right” because she did once again attract a man with these tendencies  the difference this time was that she had done a lot of work on herself and had become a stronger person  when she looked at him in our session and said to him “i don’t need you i want you  but not if you are going to continue to act like this  so you leave the house and don’t come back until you are ready to make some changes”  she stuck to that too  he didn’t leave for two more days because he kept telling her he would do different and begging to be allowed to stay  she had drawn a boundary and stuck to it and he left she was fully prepared to be single again  they actually did end up working things out in the endyou can’t let someone stay and continue to treat you badly  sure a marriage takes work and compromise on both sides  couples therapy can help you both learn to communicate in a healthier way with each other and can help you realize what areas in the relationship need work  you may not realize how some of the things you say to him comes across and he may not realize how what he says does to you  a therapist can help you with this so that you both learn how your words can hurt but you need to know your boundaries and be prepared to stick to them and not compromise your boundaries  that means following through on the threat to leave when he continues to abuse you  someone can’t do that if they are too scared to be alone  if they feel they need the other person in their life these patterns are developed in early childhood from what we learn from our parents  when someone has grown up in a dysfunctional family it is all they know  even when you can say that you realize it is a problem you still don’t know how to stop it because you never learned any other way of interacting with people  something that took a lifetime to learn will take time and work to overcome  be patient with yourself and find a good therapist  you can’t change your partner  work on you and when you begin to heal and feel healthy the right people will come into your life and stay  the more you focus on trying to change the wrong ones to be what you want the more frustrated you will become
791,why do i keep letting myself get cheated on,i would think that you hold little self worth and feel that you are not worthy of better  i would suggest that you get to know yourself   what do you need in a relationship  what is holding you to this relationship other than your child  what have gone on in the relationship that makes you think or feel you deserve such disrespect  just a few questions to ask yourself
792,why do i still feel a connection with my exboyfriend that hurt me very badly,hi atticathis is a question i think a lot of people deal withthey feel confusion about why they cannot forget about or get over someone who they absolutely know is not good for them in your case part of the problem is that he keeps trying to get back in touch with you for some people honestly it is a game to see how much power they have over you or it is their need to control you if you do not want contact from this person it is really important to give him clear messages about boundaries  and then ignore all of their communications any interactions or responses from you at all will feed their behaviour remind yourself why you do not want to be with them i hear you doing that already when you say he has nothing to offer me that is great selftalkbut let's get back to the question of why we have a hard time letting go of people like this sometimes it is because we still hope they will change maybe we remember who they used to be or how they used to treat us and we think it can go back to the way it felt in those good old days the problem there is that over the first few years as intimacy grows people tend to show more of who they are not less so what they are eventually showing you is who they are and what they are capable of people do change and grow but it will not happen at your pace accept that person for who they are and stop expecting them to change another reason we cannot let go is because we picture our ex with someone new in the future and we wonder if they will be a better person for the next partner in their life this is a normal but not a healthy thought it is as though we want them to stay maybe apologize and heal our hurts maybe make up for past mistakes you deserve that healing you deserve better than you got you deserve apologies but to expect that from the person who hurt you and has not demonstrated that compassion as yet is probably foolhardy it is my belief that underlying some of the above scenarios is the deep belief that we must somehow be responsible for the hurts our exes have caused if you blame yourself in any way for someone's poor treatment of you you will be dancing around trying to do things differently so that they can treat you better it will be impossible to let go because you blame yourself for their behavioursdraw a line their behaviours are about them not you and the only solution is to challenge and reduce thoughts of them and create physical and emotional distance these things plus time will help the events of the past fade from importance
793,why do i think about death,i will respond to your speculation that if you let go of the steering wheel while driving you will end up quite seriously hurt at the very least   it is fine to play in your mind with what ifs   people who write horror movie scripts most likely have some terrible sounding stories and suppositionsif you trust yourself to actually not follow through with an idea that may kill you and you recognize the difference between thinking dangerous things and doing dangerous things then go to the next step of understanding more about your thoughts on deathsince you wonder about being missed if you die it is possible your thoughts about death are from feeling that you are metaphysically dead to people in your life whom you wish would show more interest in youplay around with your idea as to why you would consider how people will feel about you if you are not in their livesthis may offer some insight as to your expectations of current relationships with others
794,why do i think about how easy it would be to hurt cute animals,a lot of different things could be happening here do you feel angry or sad or anxious when you think about how helpless he is if you have not actually kicked him then i would encourage you to look at feelings other than guilt since you did not hurt him what else is thereit would probably be very helpful to talk with a therapist about the specifics of this so that you can see what else is happening for you it could be that you feel safe with your cat so strong emotions come up because you feel safe
795,why do i throw all my stuff away,since you wrote that you noticed a change in your throwing away urge when you changed with which parent you lived would you feel that throwing away things is connected to wanting to be done with certain areas of influence with either parentplay in your mind with the metaphor of throwing away and whatever associations you feel toward this  are you feeling alarmed or freed by throwing away things  i am only suggesting these not telling you that they apply necessarilyanxiety comes up when people feel helpless to manage a meaningful part of their lives  so pay attention whether your stuff represents difficult scenarios or phases of your growing up years   possibly you are trying to rid yourself of painful feelings which were part of your early years' relationship with either parentbasically sounds as though you are trying to establish a clearer sense of who you are and the throwing away part is a means of discovering who you are once all the clutter is released
796,why do i want to be the opposite sex so much,"hello and thank you for reaching out to ask for help surely this is a very confusing time for you if you have never had these
feelings and desires it could certainty shake everything you thought you knew
about yourself 
my guess is that you becoming sick around the time that this
started is likely a coincidence but i understand how you would make the
connection 
i have a feeling that a few things may be going on here it
is really hard to say since i don’t know you how old you are etc but i will
share you with you some thoughts 
some people when they have undesirable thoughts that really
surprise them have a really tough time getting rid of them our reaction to
the thought can be very strong and our tendency to try to block it out stuff
it avoid it etc is not always successful in fact it’s usually not 
it’s like telling you not to think of pink elephants i
would be willing to bet that you thought of a pink elephant just now 
so rather than fighting thoughts that you find confusing
sometimes it is helpful to allow yourself to explore the thought with curiosity
and without judgement where is this thought coming from what are my feelings
about it asking yourself these questions may help you come to a resolution
about what is going on 
one possibility is that you have developed an anxiety about
your thoughts and now you are in the process of obsessing about them but
another possibility is that you are legitimately exploring your sexuality and
gender i get the feeling from your question that you do not want to believe
that it is second possibility and that is okay 
you can try some of my suggestions but you can also see a
counselor who may be able to help you work through your confusion i would
suggest someone who has experience working with sexuality issues you can
usually find out what a counselor works with on their website what is
important is that you find someone who is nonjudgmental about what you are
experiencing 
 
i wish you well

797,why do my boyfriend and i have such trouble communicating,under duress the very youngest parts of you and your boyfriend emerge so while you still look like grown ups your actions and words are motivated by very early preverbal parts of both of you in simple terms it is as if two infants somehow acquire the ability to say words but they are motivated by very basic early wounds that were created due to deficits in what was able to be done for each of you and likely understandable in terms of caregiver's life experience and that still fell short of what you needed you are both still trying to get very early needs met the best advice i can offer is to try and remember this as early as possible when things start to heat up and then restrain expression that you already know leads nowhere helpful and seek out a therapist who can help you to work with these early issues and can support you to grow and develop from this stuck pointavraham cohen phd rcc ccc
798,why do some people try to make a joke for everything and laugh at everything,i agree it is awkward when people make jokes about subjects which may not be funny at all  and if a person only jokes then after laughing and realizing the person has nothing of themselves to offer this can also be quite tediousrealize that you are more aware of human interaction having many levels of expression  you could start avoiding people who irritate you by the way they behave
799,why does it feel as if selfharm is an addiction,in a way selfharm can present somewhat like an addiction  according to new research within the field of neuroscience there is a valid explanation for this  when a person cuts or uses other forms of self harm the body produces endorphins to help make a person feel better  if a person was dealing with depression or high anxiety that might be misinterpreted by the brain as a way to help oneself feel better and a new neural network or map might form that would utilize this new behavior  another way to look at it would be thru a behavioral lens a positive reward for a behavior even though the behavior has other long term negative consequences  consider working with someone who can both have you work on and address those items that trigger your behavior and the root causes in this case sadness or depression and second find someone who can help give you alternatives that take into account the neurological requirement by replacing the behavior with another behavior and working to extinguish the unwanted behavior   someone who is trained in dialectic behavior therapy andor interpersonal neurobiology would most likely have the skills and means available to address this with you
800,why does my boyfriend think every some i like means something about our relationship,well have you told him similar descriptions of your feelings as you just wrote herethis will give him the same understanding you are allowing us to have here on this sitekeep in mind that the best the amount and the number of times you tell your boyfriend some information about you still means that whether or not he is willing to accept and rely on your information is in his hands onlytry to feel satisfied with your own effort to explain yourself   another path to open is to ask your boyfriend his reason to feel insecure about your love for him  this may open a wider discussion about what he feels he would like from you so he feels good in the relationship
801,why does my boyfriend threaten to leave every night,do the two of you ever talk over why he does this or your reaction to itare you asking your question because his behavior upsets you or only out of curiosity to understand him betterbasically first know your own reason for your question   then go ahead and tell him if what he does bothers you  in the best of cases he does not realize how his actions affect you and he will change
802,why does my granddaughter instantly switch moods,there are many possible answers here it could be that she misses friends that she felt safe in the other house  or dozens of other things will she talk about it when she is not mad you mentioned that she has an attachment issue it could also be that she was attached to the house it is not the same as being attached to a person but possessions and safe places certainly mean a lot
803,why does my husband like dressing as a female in our bedroom,depending on your own sexual history and what you grew up expecting to be normal in the bedroom i can easily imagine that this came as quite a shock to you  it does not necessarily mean however that your husband is gay bisexual transgender or even necessarily a crossdresser etc unless he has already told you so i agree with the other poster who recommended you try and ask him more questions with an open and curious attitude and see if he might be open to explaining more with you that being said what we also know from research is that frequently what turns us on is not always what we identify as  lots of people have fantasies or even sexual behaviors they may enjoy from time to time without considering themselves to be a part of any label or subculture for example many women are okay with having their hair pulled or bottom spanked during a particular rowdy sexual encounter but certainly do not consider themselves kinky submissive or anything else  it could be that your husband enjoys pretending fantasizing that he is something completely different in the bedroom from time to time from what most other see him as outside in the corporate world or in other roles he plays as husband father son friend etc  many of my kink clients are drawn to their particular fetish simply because it is the opposite of what their life typically entails  each of us has a sexual script  a blueprint if you will of what we like and do not like in the bedroom and also what we have each come to see as being normal  it is also an internal guideline for how we each define our role in sexual expression sexual orientation sexual behaviors sexual desires and how big a part our sexual identity plays in our everyday lives you have been clued into the fact that your husbands greatly differs from yours on the surface level at the moment all of us are sexual beings yet none of us is exactly identical to one another in our sexual definitions and script expectations it is like our own sex fingerprint in my role as a couples counselor i often help partners become aware of their own sexual script and explore where it overlaps their partners and where it may always differ  if a couple is able to successfully navigate formulating a plan for both to feel validated and sexually satisfied the relationship thrives most counselors would agree that a healthy script includesboth partners taking ownership for the couple's sexual experiencesboth partners learning to communicate openly and honestly about their feelingsboth partners learning to meet one another's  needs desires and wishes while making sure hisher own needs are being metif pegging your husband as it is called is a hard and fast no for you that will likely need to be respected as it may be too far off your own sexual script  however if your husband is for sure absolutely adamant about needing to dress in a female fashion andor be anally penetrated you may seek professional counseling to help navigate how both of you will come to an agreement about fulfilling these desires in a way that does not hurt either one of you or the marriagemy warmest wishes to you both
804,why does my mom show more love to my brothers than me,attention is not equal to love and being valued it may be precisely because your brothers demand so much more your mom's attention through fighting with her that she pays more attention to them it is a common situation in families where the squeaky wheel gets the grease and the siblings or family members who do not demand as much attention end up feeling invisible it sucks to feel invisible and it is important that there is attention for you and that you know how much your mom loves and values you  this sounds like an important conversation to have with your mom and if she is not able to really understand or help you address this concern you may want to suggest doing some family therapy where a skilled therapist can help you and your family work this out
805,why does my spouse tell me he does not want me but also gets jealous of me,it sounds like this is quite difficultit sounds as if sometimes your spouse want you to be a part of his life and sometimes he does not talking about this would likely be a delicate conversation and from what you mention he has been diagnosed with i am wondering if he has a therapist if so do you know whether he would allow you to come to one session so you can learn more about how he feels maybe he would be to use more of it because in the contained environment of an therapy office this way at least you would know where he is coming from you could also ask whether he is able to hear what you want wish for or desire between the two of youremember just because you hear or follow what he is saying does not imply that you agree with him although that concept in itself could be a subject of discussion because not everyone is aware of iti hope that you are able to hold onto who you are and what you want throughout this
806,why does not any guy want to date me,are there dating sites for people who have autism on the high functioning endif not then find out the names of different organizations which support people who have autism  at least one of these groups will have some guidance as to social activities for dating or even specific sites for dating when autism is a criteriaall the rejection on dating sites is rough for anyone to handlehow do you know that you are being passed over by guys who are on dating sites because you have autism    any reason is possibleunless you have heard from a few particular guys that their reason for looking beyond you is because of your autism it is possible you are in the same boat as everyone else who feels similarly frustrated by dating site rejection
807,why do not i feel normal,you may be experiencing a form of dissociation called depersonalization  people with this type of dissociation may feel disconnected from their bodies feel that they are watching their bodies from a distance or may not recognize their image in the mirror  dissociation sometimes occurs after someone experiences something traumatic  i would suggest working with a therapist who specializes in dissociative disorders as dissociation does not typically resolve on its own  on my website i have some information specific to dissociation that you may find helpful  best of luck to you
808,why have i been feeling empty lately,it has been said that depression is often the result of a blocked goal  often people struggle with both anxiety and depression but have difficulty determining which is the most important issue for some depression is the result of frequently blocked goals and when their predominant issues are evaluated they discover that they are anxious about a lot of areas in their life but seem to find no relief  when there is no relief and there have been numerous attempts to resolve the anxiety depression is often the result  in this type of case depression is not the main or underlying issue the anxiety is the underlying issue  having a lot on my mind sounds like anxiety unresolved anxiety can lead to feelings of depression which are often associated with emptiness  in the question above i would want to evaluate all of the issues surrounding having a lot on my mind and determine where these might be coming from has there been ongoing rejection from peers from family if so why does this seem to be happening  isolation is often a protective measure that one implements to avoid further pain where does that need to protect originate  are there unmet needs from childhood are there traumatic life events that have created a need to selfprotect as a defense mechanism we can feel alone even when in a crow of people or at a party  this has nothing in this case to do with being around people it has more to do with how we view ourselves  if there is a prevailing message or script that has been internalized that says you are worth nothing or you do not deserve the company of others then being around people will not alleviate the problem but only exacerbate it i would want to evaluate how one feels about themselves and what negative messages one has received and has repeated to oneself over time the developmental needs meeting strategy is a therapy aimed at addressing unmet childhood needs if there is specific trauma that is associated with socializing with people then emdr can be very helpful in desensitizing and reprocessing the trauma  looking at whether this individual's issue with emptiness is straight depression or whether it is depression as a result of unresolved anxiety is key to determining a treatment strategy
809,why is he treating me like i am not a good woman,i am less concerned about this man as bisexual and having gay friends than about how you feel is treating you  you are in a vulnerable position because of social isolation  if you have friends to talk to please reach out  while this man has money it is not his job to take care of you financially unless the two of you have decided that together  it sounds like he sometimes cares for you and other times you feel disrespected  i would suggest you look for a man that is consistent in his love and care  this is not your fault  but you are in control of removing him from you life or choosing not to because he meets some of your needs  take care
810,why is it hard for me to express myself,"let's just start with being real expressing
yourself is vulnerable and being vulnerable is hard it takes courage and work
to be vulnerable my guess is that you have been shown in your lifetime that
being vulnerable is unsafe my assumption would be
you have been criticized or ignored when you have expressed yourself in the
past it has taught your emotional self to simply not do it again this is a normal
protective mechanism that you have used to cope with past feelings of hurt it
will take time and work to engage again in an emotional wayi would start my practicing and
identifying how you feel to yourself check in with yourself multiple times a
day to gage where you are at emotionally after you feel you have a good grasp
on this start to engage in emotional conversations with others choose others that
feel safe to you a good friend that knows you well or a sibling or family
member expressing yourself is a behavior that you have suppressed out of
protection so you can choose to engage in safe emotional expression behaviors
just the same best of luck"
811,why is it so hard for me to be social,it sounds like you had a very confusing and painful experience in this relationship and now you feel hesitant to let yourself get close to people it is understandable that when we are hurt in relationships we may have trouble trusting and allowing ourselves to be vulnerable with otherstherapy is a great place to explore the roots of present difficulties in relationships to unpack what happened in prior relationships and to find new ways to show up in relationships so that we can have the relaxed intimacy that we want often relationship difficulties represent patterns of relating that we learn early in life which we may feel compelled to act on outside of our awareness and therapy provides an opportunity to become more aware of these patterns so that we can change them enabling us to feel secure and to seek out satisfying companionship
812,why is it so hard for me to talk publicly,you can learn lots of skillstechniques to feel more confident in what you need to do that will decrease your anxious response for sure  and  you can also learn how to work with your personality that may not like the attention you may find that talking to others through the internet is more comfortable and you are great at it or that you love one on one talking but are not really made for group talking there is a place in this world for you either way public speaking skills can be practiced in speech class or toastmaster group they will give you practice in a safe environment where the cool kids or cutest boy are not ready to laugh at you  what topics are you interested in and what groups can you do a little speaking up maybe in your small group at church try and raise you hand to share your opinion or maybe your girl scout troop look around for a peer and one adult who you like to hear speak out ask them to share with you 2 things that help them feel comfortable speaking in public check out some ted talks and see how they share in groups social anxiety is a difficult concern and picking apart what is your awesome personality and what needs skill building and mindfulnessanxiety  help are important steps good luck
813,why is my exboyfriend upset with me,i am glad you think so highly of your boyfriend and his ability to be there when you would like to talk about things that are important to youi see why you would want them to reach out i also wonder about how close he was with his friend and what he thought you meant when you asked him to reach out it sounds as if he is thinking that doing so would mean that he is responsible for his friend's wellbeing although i cannot say that for certainwould you be willing to have a discussion with your boyfriend where for a few minutes  you ask him about what made him react that way during this time try to listen and ask questions is if you are an investigative reporter and are trying to learn more about his experience you can also summarize what you are hearing to make sure that you understand it as he does this does not mean that you have to agree with what you say but just that you follow i hear you saying that you think he is being selfish i am suggesting that just during this conversation you ask questions to focus on what he is thinking and feeling in one sentence the goal would be to learn more about his experiencei would not be at all surprised if he is scaredare you aware of what kind of support he wants through this time
814,why is my fiancé angry at me about his automobile insurance,i would be more worried generally about a fiancee who assumes you are responsible for tracking what in fact are his responsibilities than about the anger per sewhat you describe holds the seeds of classic abusive behavior which is blaming the partner for what in fact are the persongs own responsibilitiesstart by withdrawing yourself from paying his billsif he is on his own in terms of tracking what and when is due regarding his auto policy then surely the only one for him to blame will be himselfstay clear of involving yourself in doing favors for him if the favor involves something that he is the one accountabletell him it is so the relationship remains fair for each of you
815,i feel like i was born in the wrong body,hi do you have any opportunity to work with a therapist  it sounds like it might be really great to explore these feelings if you are not able to there are many awesome gender work books available that you could use to explore your thoughts and feelings also  google ask a gender therapist  so many amazing video blogs to answer many questions  good luck
816,i need answers to my angry possessiveness and urges,what result are you hoping to get from the behaviors you describemaybe start by comparing the results you see yourself receiving from your current interactions with how you would wish to feel from relating to otherssince you ask what is wrong with me there is a disconnect between what you are doing and what you would like in returnthis is true even with imagining doing harm to otherswhat are you really trying to accomplish for yourself by hurting othersbesides the unethicalness and criminality of this and legal consequences of arrest for such behaviors what gain which is not evil do you expect from overpowering and imagining you control another human being
