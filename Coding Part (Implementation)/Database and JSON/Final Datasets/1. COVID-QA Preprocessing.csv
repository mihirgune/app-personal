617,how much is the difference between the human sarscov2 and the bat ratg13cov,greater than 1100 nt 
618,why is it highly unlikely that ratg13 cov is the immediate source of sarscov2 ,are distributed throughout the genome in a naturally occurring pattern following the evolutionary characteristics typical of covs
619,what are the most revealing signs that sarscov2 evolved by natural evolution ,the absence of a logical targeted pattern in the new viral sequences and a close relative in a wildlife species bat
620,what did the nature medicine paper report,the construction of a chimeric cov with a bat cov s gene in the backbone of a sars cov that has adapted to infect mice and is capable of infecting human cells
621,why does the claim lack any scientific basis, because of significant divergence in the genetic sequence of this construct with the new sarscov2 
622,how was the mouseadapted sars virus generated,by serial passage of an infectious wildtype sars cov clone in the respiratory tract of balbc mice
623,how did the sarscov gain elevated replication and lung pathogenesis in aged mice ,due to six coding genetic mutations associated with mouse adaptation 
624,why is it likely that ma15 is highly attenuated to replicate in human cells,due to the mouse adaptation
625,why were civets proposed to be an intermediate host of the batcovs capable of spreading sars cov to humans,t was proposed that the s gene from batderived cov unlike that from human patientsor civetsderived viruses was unable to use human ace2 as a receptor for entry into human cells 
626,what was the finding in 2013,several novel bat coronaviruses were isolated from chinese horseshoe bats and the bat sarslike or slcovwiv1 was able to use ace2 from humans civets and chinese horseshoe bats for entry 
627, why is it proposed that some bat slcovs may be able to directly infect human hosts,combined with evolutionary evidence that the bat ace2 gene has been positively selected at the same contact sites as the human ace2 gene for interacting with sars cov [
628,what was done to test if an intermediate host may not be necessary and that some bat slcovs may be able to directly infect human hosts t, the exact s gene from bat coronavirus slshc014 was synthesized and used to generate a chimeric virus in the mouse adapted ma15 sarscov backbone 
629,what were the results of this test,the resultant slshc014ma15 virus could indeed efficiently use human ace2 and replicate in primary human airway cells to similar titres as epidemic strains of sarscov while slshc014ma15 can replicate efficiently in young and aged mouse lungs infection was attenuated and less virus antigen was present in the airway epithelium as compared to sars ma15 which causes lethal outcomes in aged mice
630,why were experiments with slshc014ma15 chimeric virus were later restricted,as gain of function studies under the us governmentmandated pause policy 
631,why is there no credible evidence to support the claim that the sarscov2 is derived from the chimeric slshc014ma15 virus,upon careful phylogenetic analyses by multiple international groups  the sarscov2 is undoubtedly distinct from slshc014ma15 with 6000 nucleotide differences across the whole genome
632,what did the rumour that the virus was made by humans in the lab claim,that sarscov2 has hiv sequence in it and was thus likely generated in the laboratory i
633,what was reported in a rebuttal paper led by an hiv1 virologist dr feng gao, they used careful bioinformatics analyses to demonstrate that the original claim of multiple hiv insertions into the sarscov2 is not hiv1 specific but random 
634,what happened to the report with initial claims, because of the many concerns raised by the international community the authors who made the initial claim have already withdrawn this report
635,what is the difference between evolution and synthetic constructs,evolution is stepwise and accrues mutations gradually over time whereas synthetic constructs would typically use a known backbone and introduce logical or targeted changes instead of the randomly occurring mutations that are present in naturally isolated viruses such as bat cov ratg13
636,what is the conclusion of this report, there is currently no credible evidence to support the claim that sarscov2 originated from a laboratoryengineered cov it is more likely that sarscov2 is a recombinant cov generated in nature between a bat cov and another coronavirus in an intermediate animal host 
637,what is the conclusion of this report,more studies are needed to explore this possibility and resolve the natural origin of sarscov2 we should emphasize that although sarscov2 shows no evidence of laboratory origin viruses with such great public health threats must be handled properly in the laboratory and also properly regulated by the scientific community and governments

737,what is the advantage of adenovirus as vaccine delivery vector,adenovirus vector is another of the most widely evaluated vectors to date to express heterologous antigens due to ease of production safety profile genetic stability the ease of dna genome manipulation and the ability to stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses and induce both t and b cell responses 
738,what are important criteria for selecting vaccine delivery vectors,a vaccine should be inexpensive so that it can be administered to a large population at minimal cost
739,what are important criteria for selecting vaccine delivery vectors,safety is a major concern as even a low level of toxicity is unacceptable 
740,what are important criteria for selecting vaccine delivery vectors,longlasting cellular and humoral immune responses to the vectored antigen must be induced following administration of these vaccines preferably with a single dose
741,what happens when a recipient of a vaccine has immune response to the delivery vector,considering a vector such as salmonella if a host has previously been infected there will exist robust b and t memory responses and as such when a vaccination is delivered an anamnestic response to the salmonella antigens will be induced 
742,what is the effect of host immune response to the delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination,for virally vectored antigens the existence of preexisting immunity to the vector will restrict delivery of the virus into cells thereby effectively reducing the dose of the vectored antigen again this might be expected to result in a reduction in the antigenicity of the vectored antigen
743,what is the effect of host immune response to the delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination,theoretically reduce the exposure of the heterologous antigen to the immune system as the vector is rapidly cleared
744,what is an example of the effect of immunity to the delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination,mice that had been primed with salmonella alone and then boosted with salmonella expressing tetc induced much lower antitetc responses than mice that had not been primed this argues strongly that prior immunological immunity to the vector can seriously dampen subsequent antigenspecific humoral responses
745,what is the effect of host immune response to viral delivery vectors in the efficacy of vaccination,preexisting immunity is a major obstacle of many viralvectored vaccines such as ad serotype 5 or herpes simplex virus type 1  where the rate of seroprevalence to these viruses is very high of the us population respectively] 
746,what is the effect of host immune response to the viral delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination,vectorspecific antibodies may impede the induction of immune responses to the vaccineencoded antigens as they may reduce the dose and time of exposure of the target cells to the vaccinated antigens
747,what is the effect of host immune response to the delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination, in a largescale clinical trial of an ad serotype 5 based hiv1 vaccine the vaccines showed a lack of efficacy and tended to increase the risk of hiv1 infection in vaccine recipients who had preexisting neutralizing antibodies to adhu5 
748,what are methods to avoid the effect vector immunity on the efficacy of vaccination, the use of vectors derived from nonhuman sources using human viruses of rare serotypes  heterologous primeboost approaches  homologous reimmunization and removing key neutralizing epitopes on the surface of viral capsid proteins 
749,what are methods to avoid the effect of vector immune response on the efficacy of vaccination,"the inhibitory effect of preexisting immunity can also be avoided by masking the ad vector inside dendritic cells   in addition mucosal vaccination or administration of higher vaccine doses can overcome preexisting immunity problems 
"
750,how does cellmediated immunity to viral delivery vector reduce the immune response to vaccine, this is because viruses will induce neutralizing antibody on the first dose and in subsequent doses this antibody will limit the number of transduced cells therefore limiting the responses this is particularly a problem with a common viral vector such as ad where a large proportion of the population will have immunological memory against common serotypes
751,how can vectors for which host has immunity be used differently to increase the efficacy of vaccination," it will be possible to utilize such vectors only by developing vaccines from alternative serotypes it may be that a vector such as preexisting immunity against vaccine vectors attenuated influenza virus with the ability to easily develop reassortants will be useful in this context

in addition immunological memory in the form of opsonizing antibody certainly plays an important role in the early uptake of salmonella by macrophages and dc this may be beneficial as the live bacterial vector used for delivery purposes harbours mutations in genes encoding proteins responsible for their survival in the animal host this not only encumbers their ability to cause disease making them safe live vectors but also limits the number of replications the presence of opsonizing antibodies should mean a higher level of bacterial uptake leading to higher presentation to the immune system and therefore a better immune response"

1263,what is needed to elucidate zoonotic emergence,a mechanistic understanding of the impact of bats’ virus hosting capacities including uniquely constitutive immune pathways on cellularscale viral dynamics
1264,what is the conclusion of this report, heightened immune responses limit pathogeninduced cellular morbidity which can facilitate the establishment of rapidlypropagating persistent infections withinhost rapidlytransmitting viruses that have evolved with bat immune systems will likely cause enhanced virulence following emergence into secondary hosts with immune systems that diverge from those unique to bats
1265,why have bats received attention in recent years,for their role as reservoir hosts for emerging viral zoonoses including rabies and related lyssaviruses hendra and nipah henipaviruses ebola and marburg filoviruses and sars coronavirus 
1266,what difference bats demonstrate compared to most nonchiropteran mammals,no obvious disease symptoms upon infection with pathogens that are highly virulent in nonvolant mammals but may instead support viruses as longterm persistent infections rather than transient immunizing pathologies
1267,what suite of speciesspecific mechanisms do bats have to limit viral load,host receptor sequence incompatibilities for some batvirus combinations and constitutive expression of the antiviral cytokine
1268,how are mammalian cells typically rendered antiviral, the presence of viral rna or dna in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells will induce secretion of type i interferon proteins  which promote expression and translation of interferonstimulated genes in neighboring cells 
1269,in nonflying mammals what what would be elicited by ifn expression upon viral infection,widespread inflammation and concomitant immunopathology upon viral infection
1270,what do the bats do instead,bats support unique adaptations to combat inflammation
1271,why may the bats have this unique adaptation,to mitigate metabolic damage induced during flight
1272,why was the field of virus dynamics developed,to describe the mechanistic underpinnings of longterm patterns of steadystate viral load exhibited by patients in chronic phase infections with hiv who appeared to produce and clear virus at equivalent rates 
1273,how are bats connected to fatal viral diseases,bats are natural reservoirs for viruses that have some of the highest fatality rates of any viruses that people acquire from wild animals including rabies ebola and the sars coronavirus
1274,what is an example of antiviral defense in bats,some bats have an antiviral immune response called the interferon pathway perpetually switched on
1275,what would be caused by this hypervigilance in most other mammals, harmful inflammation
1276,how are bats different,bats however have adapted antiinflammatory traits that protect them from such harm include the loss of certain genes that normally promote inflammation
1277,what bat species cells were compared,the black flying fox in which the interferon pathway is always on and another the egyptian fruit bat in which this pathway is only activated during an infection
1278,what was the conclusion of the study , in both bat species the strongest antiviral responses were countered by the virus spreading more quickly from cell to cell this suggests that bat immune defenses may drive the evolution of faster transmitting viruses and while bats are well protected from the harmful effects of their own prolific viruses other creatures like humans are not
1279,what would be the benefit of learning more about bat's defenses and how they drive virus evolution,help scientists develop better ways to predict prevent or limit the spread of viruses from bats to humans

1282,which cells express constitutive ifna,pakit01 cell
1283,how were the spread of gfpexpressing virusinfected cells across tissue monolayers tracked via inverted fluorescence microscopy,because plaque assays restrict viral transmission neighbortoneighbor in twodimensional cellular space 
1284,how were the spread of gfpexpressing virusinfected cells tracked, for each infection trial we monitored and reimaged plates for up to 200 hr of observations or until total monolayer destruction processed resulting images and generated a time series of the proportion of infectiouscell occupied plate space across the duration of each trial  we used generalized additive models to infer the time course of all cell culture replicates and construct the multitrial dataset to which we eventually fit our mechanistic transmission model for each cell linevirusspecific combinatio
1285,how was the modeling carried out,an innovative combination of in vitro experimentation and withinhost modeling to explore the impact of unique bat immunity on virus dynamics
1286,what was the finding in this study,that bat cell lines demonstrated a signature of enhanced interferonmediated immune response of either constitutive or induced form which allowed for establishment of rapid withinhost celltocell virus transmission rates 
1287,what supports the results,by both dataindependent bifurcation analysis of our mean field theoretical model as well as fitting of this model to viral infection time series established in bat cell culture
1288,what was additionally demonstrated,the antiviral state induced by the interferon pathway protects live cells from mortality in tissue culture resulting in in vitro epidemics of extended duration that enhance the probability of establishing a longterm persistent infection
1289,what do the studies suggest,that viruses evolved in bat reservoirs possessing enhanced ifn capabilities could achieve more rapid withinhost transmission rates without causing pathology to their hosts such rapidlyreproducing viruses would likely generate extreme virulence upon spillover to hosts lacking similar immune capacities to bats
1290,what was the methodology for this study,we first developed a novel withinhost theoretical model elucidating the effects of unique bat immunity then undertook bifurcation analysis of the model's equilibrium properties under immune absent induced and constitutive assumptions we considered a cell line to be constitutively immune if possessing any number of antiviral cells at diseasefree equilibrium but allowed the extent of constitutive immunity to vary across the parameter range for  the constitutive rate of antiviral acquisition 
1291,what was demonstrated in deriving the equation for r 0, invasion threshold is elevated at high values of constitutive antiviral acquisition
1292,what is a conclusion of the modeling,constitutive immune processes can thus prohibit pathogen invasion while induced responses by definition can only control infections posthoc
1293,what is a conclusion of the study,regardless of mechanism  interferonstimulated antiviral cells appear to play a key role in maintaining longer term or persistent infections by safeguarding susceptible cells from rapid infection and concomitant cell death 
1294,what do fits to rvsvmarv infections on pakit01 cells suggest,that the constitutive ifna expression characteristic of p alecto cells may represent more of a constitutive immune priming process than a perpetual functional antiviral defense
1295,what do the findings indicate,enhanced ifnmediated immune pathways in bat reservoirs may promote elevated withinhost virus replication rates prior to crossspecies emergence 
1296,what is presented in this study,general methods to study crossscale viral dynamics which suggest that withinhost persistence is supported by robust antiviral responses characteristic of bat immune processes 
1297,what is a conclusion of this study, viruses which evolve rapid replication rates under these robust antiviral defenses may pose the greatest hazard for crossspecies pathogen emergence into spillover hosts with immune systems that differ from those unique to bats

1462,when did china detect the first human case of h7n9 infection,february 2013
1463,how many deaths were associated with merscov as of july 2014,288
1464,what illness is caused by the 2019ncov coronavirus,the novel coronavirus infection caused pneumonia 
1465,in addition to oral swabs which tests detected the presence of 2019ncov virus,the 2109ncov rna was readily detected in the blood and the anal swabs  
1466,what is the relationship between the presence of virus in blood and anal swabs and disease severity,all of the 6 patients with detectable viral rna in the blood cohort progressed to severe symptom stage indicating a strong correlation of serum viral rna with the disease severity  meanwhile 8 of the 11 patients with annal swab viruspositive was in severe clinical stage
1467,which patients were classified as severe in chinese guidelines,patients who were with at least one of the following symptom should be diagnosed to be severe case 1 distress of respiratory with respiratory rate   30min 2 oxygen saturation   93% in the rest state and 3 arterial oxygen tension over inspiratory oxygen fraction of less than 300 mm hg in the blood detection cohort  patients who had at less one serum sample measurement with the pcr method were included 
1468,what is the relationship between the presence of virus in blood sample and disease severity, in the 57 6 cases were detected to be blood positive all of them were severe in symptom requiring special care attention and the blood of the rest 51 cases was without detectable virus in the blood only 12 of them were severe cases
1469,what test could give an indication for special care for 2019ncov patients,presence of viral rna outside of the respiratory tract might herald the severity of the disease and alarm the requirement of special care
1470,what is the relationship between the presence of virus in anal swabs and disease severity in 2019ncov,in the anal swab cohort  11 of 28 cases were detected to be anal swab positive 8 of them were with severe symptoms which was significantly higher than that 4 of the rest 17 cases without detectable virus in anal were severe cases
1471,what could be the implication of 2019ncov virus in anal swabs,digestive tract might be one extrapulmonary site for virus replication
1472,what could account for the high transmission rate of the 2019ncov virus,intensive structural analysis of the s protein of 2019ncov with the sarscoronavirus suggested that several critical residues in the viral spike protein might confer favourable interaction with human ace2  of note ace2 is also abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the small intestine besides the respiratory tract and is ubiquitously present in endothelial cells  which might provide possible routes of transmission and might account for the high transmission capacity of the new virus 
1473,what could account for the dissemination of the 2019ncov virus across the whole body,we propose that rampant coronavirus replication in pulmonary alveolus results in the breakdown of the alveolar vessel and the subsequent virus leakage into the blood flow through which the virus is disseminated across the whole body then the virus succeeds in establishing reinfection in the digestive tract by using the highly expressed ace2 receptor which exacerbated the disease vice versa

1560,what is this disease characterized by , airway inflammation leading to complications such as coughing wheezing and shortness of breath 
1561,where can this disease manifest, in both the upper airway and lower airway 
1562,why do treatment and management vary in efficacy,due to the complexity and heterogeneity of the disease
1563,what complicates this further,the effect of episodic exacerbations of the disease defined as worsening of disease symptoms including wheeze cough breathlessness and chest tightness 
1564,what are such exacerbations due to,the effect of enhanced acute airway inflammation impacting upon and worsening the symptoms of the existing disease
1565,what do the acute exacerbations cause,morbidity and sometimes mortality in patients as well as resulting in major economic burdens worldwide
1566,what are acute exacerbations usually due to ,the presence of environmental factors such as allergens pollutants smoke cold or dry air and pathogenic microbes in the airway
1567,what does the immune response elicited by these agents lead to, infiltration of activated immune cells that further release inflammatory mediators that cause acute symptoms such as increased mucus production cough wheeze and shortness of breath 
1568,among these agents which is a major driver,viral infection is one of the major drivers of asthma exacerbations accounting for up to 8090% and 4580% of exacerbations in children and adults respectively

1573,what is the lower airway the site of,dysregulated inflammation in most chronic airway inflammatory diseases
1574,where is the the first point of contact with sources of exacerbation,the upper airway
1575,what is the focus of this review, recent findings of viral interaction with the upper airway
1576,what is complied by the authors,how viral induced changes to the upper airway may contribute to chronic airway inflammatory disease exacerbations to provide a unified elucidation of the potential exacerbation mechanisms initiated from predominantly upper airway infections
1577,before linking respiratory viruses what was linked to acute exacerbations,despite being a major cause of exacerbation reports linking respiratory viruses to acute exacerbations only start to emerge in the late 1950s  with bacterial infections previously considered as the likely culprit for acute exacerbation 
1578,what did the advent of pcr technology lead to, viruses were recovered during acute exacerbations events and reports implicating their role emerged in the late 1980s
1579,what are the predominant viruses linked to airway inflammatory diseases,rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus 
1580,what other viruses are implicated in acute exacerbations but to a much lesser extent,parainfluenza virus  influenza virus and adenovirus 
1581,what other viruses have been recently reported as contributing to acute exacerbations, viruses including bocavirus  human metapneumovirus  certain coronavirus strains a specific enterovirus strain evd68 human cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus 
1582,what are the common feature of these viruses share,they can infect both the upper andor lower airway further increasing the inflammatory conditions in the diseased airway
1583,where do the respiratory viruses primarily infect and replicate,within airway epithelial cells 
1584,what happens during the replication process,the cells release antiviral factors and cytokines that alter local airway inflammation and airway niche 
1585,what does the inflammation lead to in healthy airways,leads to type 1 inflammatory responses consisting of activation of an antiviral state and infiltration of antiviral effector cells this eventually results in the resolution of the inflammatory response and clearance of the viral infection 
1586,how may the responses be different in a chronically inflamed airway, the responses against the virus may be impaired or aberrant causing sustained inflammation and erroneous infiltration resulting in the exacerbation of their symptoms  this is usually further compounded by the increased susceptibility of chronic airway inflammatory disease patients toward viral respiratory infections thereby increasing the frequency of exacerbation as a whole
1587,what will the review focus on,compiling and collating the current known mechanisms of viralinduced exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases as well as linking the different viral infection pathogenesis to elucidate other potential ways the infection can exacerbate the disease
1588,how will this review serve,to provide further understanding of viral induced exacerbation to identify potential pathways and pathogenesis mechanisms that may be targeted as supplementary care for management and prevention of exacerbation
1589,why is this approach significant,due to the current scarcity of antiviral drugs for the management of viralinduced exacerbations
1590,what happens upon infection,viruses evoke an inflammatory response as a means of counteracting the infection
1591,how does the infected airway cell respond,generally infected airway epithelial cells release type i and type iii interferons cytokines and chemokines such as il6 il8 il12 rantes macrophage inflammatory protein 1α and monocyte chemotactic protein 1  
1592,what does the epithelial proteins cause,enable infiltration of innate immune cells and of professional antigen presenting cells that will then in turn release specific mediators to facilitate viral targeting and clearance including type ii interferon  il2 il4 il5 il9 and il12 
1593,what is the effect of these factors,these factors heighten local inflammation and the infiltration of granulocytes tcells and bcells  the increased inflammation in turn worsens the symptoms of airway diseases
1594,what additional effects are caused in patients with asthma and patients with crs with nasal polyp ,viral infections such as rv and rsv promote a type 2biased immune response  this amplifies the basal type 2 inflammation resulting in a greater release of il4 il5 il13 rantes and eotaxin and a further increase in eosinophilia a key pathological driver of asthma and crswnp
1595,what is the result of increased eosinophilia,worsens the classical symptoms of disease and may further lead to lifethreatening conditions due to breathing difficulties
1596,what are the effects for patients with copd and patients with crs without nasal polyp ,are more neutrophilic in nature due to the expression of neutrophil chemoattractants such as cxcl9 cxcl10 and cxcl11  the pathology of these airway diseases is characterized by airway remodeling due to the presence of remodeling factors such as matrix metalloproteinases released from infiltrating neutrophils  viral infections in such conditions will then cause increase neutrophilic activation worsening the symptoms and airway remodeling in the airway thereby exacerbating copd crssnp and even crswnp in certain cases 
1597, which are the type 2 inflammatory cytokines expressed by the epithelial cells upon injury to the epithelial barrier, il25 il33 and tslp 
1598,which cells lacking both b and t cell receptors but play a crucial role in secreting type 2 cytokines to perpetuate type 2 inflammation when activated , ilc2s are a group of lymphoid cells
1599,what is the effect cell death and injury to the epithelial barrier due to infection,induce the expression of il25 il33 and tslp with heighten expression in an inflamed airway
1600,what happens when the 3 cytokines are expressed,these 3 cytokines then work in concert to activate ilc2s to further secrete type 2 cytokines il4 il5 and il13 which further aggravate the type 2 inflammation in the airway causing acute exacerbation 
1601,what happens in the case of copd, increased ilc2 activation which retain the capability of differentiating to ilc1 may also further augment the neutrophilic response and further aggravate the exacerbation
1602,what happens during viral infection of healthy individuals, these factors are not released to any great extent and do not activate an ilc2 response during viral infection in healthy individuals  despite augmenting a type 2 exacerbation in chronically inflamed airways  these classical mechanisms of viral induced acute exacerbations are summarized in figure 1 
1603,what happens upon viral infection in the airway,antiviral state will be activated to clear the invading pathogen from the airway immune response and injury factors released from the infected epithelium normally would induce a rapid type 1 immunity that facilitates viral clearance 
1604,what is the effect of the inflammation of the airway, however in the inflamed airway the cytokines and chemokines released instead augmented the inflammation present in the chronically inflamed airway strengthening the neutrophilic infiltration in copd airway and eosinophilic infiltration in the asthmatic airway the effect is also further compounded by the participation of th1 and ilc1 cells in the copd airway and th2 and ilc2 cells in the asthmatic airway
1605,what increases the severity of exacerbations in the airway,the synergistic effect of viral infection with other sensitizing agents 
1606,why viruses do not need to directly infect the lower airway to cause an acute exacerbation,he nasal epithelium remains the primary site of most infections
1607,what is suggested by the fact that not all viral infections of the airway lead to acute exacerbations,a more complex interplay between the virus and upper airway epithelium which synergize with the local airway environment in line with the united airway hypothesis 
1608,what is the effect of chronic airway inflammatory disease in patients,viral infections or their components persist in patients
1609,what is the effect of chronic airway inflammatory disease,may further alter the local environment and contribute to current and future exacerbations
1610,why should future studies be performed using metagenomics in addition to pcr analysis ,to determine the contribution of the microbiome and mycobiome to viral infections
1611,what is highlighted by the authors in this review, recent data regarding viral interactions with the airway epithelium that could also contribute to or further aggravate acute exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases
1612,who has impaired or reduced ability of viral clearance ,patients with chronic airway inflammatory diseases 
1613,what does their impairment stems from,a type 2skewed inflammatory response which deprives the airway of important type 1 responsive cd8 cells that are responsible for the complete clearance of virusinfected cells 
1614,where is this especially evident,in weak type 1 inflammationinducing viruses such as rv and rsv
1615,what are other effects,there are also evidence of reduced type i and iii interferon production due to type 2skewed inflammation which contributes to imperfect clearance of the virus resulting in persistence of viral components or the live virus in the airway epithelium 
1616,what is the effect of viral components remaining in the airway,antiviral genes such as type i interferons inflammasome activating factors and cytokines remained activated resulting in prolong airway inflammation
1617,what do these factors do,enhance granulocyte infiltration thus prolonging the exacerbation symptoms such persistent inflammation may also be found within dna viruses such as adv hcmv and hsv whose infections generally persist longer  further contributing to chronic activation of inflammation when they infect the airway
1618,what is also linked with the chronic inflammation that precedes the malignancies,human papilloma virus  a dna virus highly associated with head and neck cancers and respiratory papillomatosis
1619,what should be investigated in the future, the role of hpv infection in causing chronic inflammation in the airway and their association to exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases which is scarcely explored
1620,what further can viral persistence lead to,viral persistence which lead to continuous expression of antiviral genes may also lead to the development of steroid resistance which is seen with rv rsv and piv infection
1621,what effect the use of steroids to suppress inflammation can have,may also cause the virus to linger longer in the airway due to the lack of antiviral clearance
1622,what should be further focus of research,the concomitant development of steroid resistance together with recurring or prolong viral infection 
1623,which viruses may not cause prolonged inflammation due to strong induction of antiviral clearance,viruses that induce strong type 1 inflammation and cell death such as ifv and certain cov 
1624,what do these infections cause,massive damage and cell death to the epithelial barrier so much so that areas of the epithelium may be completely absent post infection  factors such as rantes and cxcl10 which recruit immune cells to induce apoptosis are strongly induced from ifv infected epithelium 
1625,what do the necroptotic factors such as rip3 do, further compounds the cell deaths in ifv infected epithelium  the massive cell death induced may result in worsening of the acute exacerbation due to the release of their cellular content into the airway further evoking an inflammatory response in the airway 
1626,what may the destruction of the epithelial barrier cause, further contact with other pathogens and allergens in the airway which may then prolong exacerbations or results in new exacerbations
1627,what may the epithelial destruction cause,may also promote further epithelial remodeling during its regeneration as viral infection induces the expression of remodeling genes such as mmps and growth factors  infections that cause massive destruction of the epithelium such as ifv usually result in severe acute exacerbations with nonclassical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases
1628,what is recommended that patients with chronic airway inflammatory disease, receive their annual influenza vaccination as the best means to prevent severe ifv induced exacerbation
1629,what is another mechanism that viral infections use to drive acute exacerbations,the induction of vasodilation or tight junction opening factors which may increase the rate of infiltration 
1630,what does infection of respiratory viruses cause,disruption of tight junctions with the resulting increased rate of viral infiltration this also increases the chances of allergens coming into contact with airway immune cells
1631,what is an example of this, ifv infection was found to induce oncostatin m which causes tight junction opening  similarly rv and rsv infections usually cause tight junction opening which may also increase the infiltration rate of eosinophils and thus worsening of the classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases

1656,what are both ifv and rsv infections shown to do, to increase mir21 and augmented inflammation in experimental murine asthma models which is reversed with a combination treatment of antimir21 and corticosteroids
1657,what are ifv infection shown to do, increase mir125a and b and mir132 in copd epithelium which inhibits a20 and mavs and p300 and irf3 respectively resulting in increased susceptibility to viral infections 
1658,what happens in in asthmatic epithelium in ifv infection,mir22 was shown to be suppressed in asthmatic epithelium in ifv infection which lead to aberrant epithelial response contributing to exacerbations 
1659,what do noncoding rnas present as,as targets to modulate viral induced airway changes as a means of managing exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases
1660,what mechanisms other than mirna modulation play a role,epigenetic modification such as dna methylation 
1661,what have recent epigenetic studies indicated,the association of epigenetic modification and chronic airway inflammatory diseases and that the nasal methylome was shown to be a sensitive marker for airway inflammatory changes 
1662, what have these studies also shown, viral infections such as rv and rsv alters dna methylation and histone modifications in the airway epithelium which may alter inflammatory responses driving chronic airway inflammatory diseases and exacerbations
1663,what has spalluto etal have shown,that antiviral factors such as ifnγ epigenetically modifies the viral resistance of epithelial cells
1664, what infections such as rv and rsv that weakly induce antiviral responses may result in, an altered inflammatory state contributing to further viral persistence and exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases 
1665,what can viral infection result in, enhanced production of reactive oxygen species  oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in the airway epithelium 
1666,what sustains the inflammation in the airway,state of constant oxidative stress 
1667,what may viral infections of the respiratory epithelium by viruses such as ifv rv rsv and hsv do,may trigger the further production of ros as an antiviral mechanism
1668,what can happen in response to the infection such as neutrophils, infiltrating cells in response to the infection such as neutrophils will also trigger respiratory burst as a means of increasing the ros in the infected region the increased ros and oxidative stress in the local environment may serve as a trigger to promote inflammation thereby aggravating the inflammation in the airway 
1669,in addition to worsening disease symptoms what do viralinduced exacerbations do, also may alter the management of the disease or confer resistance toward treatments that worked before 
1670,what may studies in natural exacerbations and in viralchallenge models using rnasequencing or single cell rnaseq on a range of timepoints provide,important information regarding viral pathogenesis and changes induced within the airway of chronic airway inflammatory disease patients to identify novel targets and pathway for improved management of the disease

1745,how is 2019ncov transmitted,2019ncov was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia
1746,what are ways in which 2019ncov is transmitted,we found the presence of 2019ncov in anal swabs and blood as well and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral–fecal route
1747,is oral swab for detecting 2019ncov infection sufficient,the current strategy for the detection of viral rna in oral swabs used for 2019ncov diagnosis is not perfect the virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
1748,is oral swab for detecting 2019ncov infection sufficient, patients infected with 2019ncov may harbour the virus in the intestine at the early or late stage of disease it is also worth to note none of the patients with viremia blood had positive swabs these patients would likely be considered as 2019ncov negative through routine surveillance and thus pose a threat to other people
1749,what other tests should be considered for 2019ncov epidemiology,serology should be considered for 2019ncov epidemiology
1750,what tests should be done before a 2019ncov infected patient is discharged,we cannot discharge a patient purely based on oral swabs negative who may still shed the virus by oralfecal route above all we strongly suggest using viral igm and igg serological test to confirm an infection considering the unreliable results from oral swabs detection

1797,what does the analysis show on the difference between locally acquired cases vs imported cases,that the time from symptom onset to hospitalisationcase isolation was about 3 days longer for locally acquired cases than for imported cases
1798,what is required for locally acquired cases,"significant resources for contact tracing and quarantine and countries should be prepared to allocate considerable public health resources during the containment phase should local clusters emerge in their population in addition prompt sharing of information on cases and contacts through international notification systems such as the international health regulations mechanism and the european commissiongs european early warning and response system is essential to contain international spread of infection

1856,what assay played an important role,reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
1857,what was the death toll in the 19181919 spanish influenza epidemic,50 million deaths worldwide
1858,how many people were infected during the 1918 spanish influenza epidemic,"an estimated one third of the world’s population or
z500 million persons were infected and had clinical
ly apparent illnesses"
1859,what was the case fatality rate in the 1918 spanish influenza epidemic,"case
fatality rates were 25% compared to 01% in other
inﬂuenza pandemics"
1860,what was the death toll in the 19181919 spanish influenza epidemic,"total deaths were estimated at
z50 million and were arguably as high as 100 mil
lion "
1861,are the modern day influenza viruses related to the 1918 spanish influenza virus," all inﬂuenza a pandemics since that time and
indeed almost all cases of inﬂuenza a worldwide except
ing human infections from avian viruses such as h5n1 and
h7n7 have been caused by descendants of the 1918
virus including “drifted” h1n1 viruses and reassorted
h2n2 and h3n2 viruses"
1862,why is the spanish influenza virus the mother of the modern influenza viruses,"the latter are composed of key
genes from the 1918 virus updated by subsequentlyincor—
porated avian inﬂuenza genes that code for novel surface

and tnational institutes of health bethesda maryland usa

proteins making the 1918 virus indeed the “mother” of all
pandemics"
1863,when was it determined that the 1918 pandemic was caused by the h1n1 influenza virus,"that question did not begin to be resolved until the 1930s
when closely related inﬂuenza viruses now known to be
h1n1 viruses were isolated ﬁrst from pigs and shortly
thereafter from humans seroepidemiologic studies soon
linked both of these viruses to the 1918 pandemic"
1864,did the spanish influenza or swine flu or the h1n1 virus disappear in humans for some time," descendants of the 1918
virus still persists enzootically in pigs they probably also
circulated continuously in humans undergoing gradual
antigenic drift and causing annual epidemics until the
1950s with the appearance of a new h2n2 pandemic
strain in 1957  the direct h1n1 viral descen
dants 0f the 1918 pandemic strain disappeared from human
circulation entirely although the related lineage persisted
enzootically in pigs"
1865,when did the swine flu virus reappear in humans," but in 1977 human h1n1 viruses
suddenly “reemerged” from a laboratory freezer  they
continue to circulate endemically and epidemically"
1866,what descendant lineages of the swine flu virus were identified in 2006," 2 major descendant lineages of the 1918
h1n1 virus as well as 2 additional reassortant lineages
persist naturally a human epidemicendemic h1n1 line
age a porcine enzootic h1n1 lineage socalled classic
swine ﬂu and the reassorted human h3n2 virus lineage
which like the human h1n1 virus has led to a porcine
h3n2 lineage"
1867,are the modern descendant influenza viruses as dangerous as the 1918 parent swine flu h1n1 virus,"none of these viral descendants however
approaches the pathogenicity of the 1918 parent virus"
1868,how dangerous are the modern h1n1 and the h3n2 viruses compared to the 1918 h1n1  viruses,"the human h1n1 and h3n2 lin
eages have both been associated with substantially lower
rates ofillness and death than the virus of 1918 in fact cur
rent h1n1 death rates are even lower than those for h3n2
lineage strains "
1869,are the descendant h1n1 strains of the 1918 h1n1 swine flu virus still prevalent,"h1n1 viruses descended from the 1918 strain as well as 
h3n2 viruses have now been cocirculating worldwide for
29 years and show little evidence of imminent extinction"
1870,is the origin and epidemiology of the 1918 swine flu known,"ongoing studies to map virulence
factors are yielding interesting results the 1918 sequence
data however leave unanswered questions about the ori
gin of the virus and about the epidemiology of the
pandemic"
1871,what is the geographical origin of the h1n1 swine flu ,"historical and epidemiologic data are inade
quate to identify the geographic origin of the virus 
and recent phylogenetic analysis of the 1918 viral genome
does not place the virus in any geographic context"
1872,is the geographical origin of the 1918 h1n1 swine flu known,"confounding deﬁnite assignment of a geographic
point of origin the 1918 pandemic spread more or less
simultaneously in 3 distinct waves during an z12month
period in 191871919 in europe asia and north america
the ﬁrst wave was best described in the united states in
march 1918"
1873,what is an unique feature of the 1918 swine flu,"the simultaneous infection
of humans and swin"
1874,what season or time of the year do the new strains of influenza emerge,"historical records since the 16th century suggest that
new inﬂuenza pandemics may appear at any time of year
not necessarily in the familiar annual winter patterns of
interpandemic years"
1875,once appeared when do the influenza like diseases occur in subsequent years,"confronted by the selection pressures of population immu
nity these pandemic viruses begin to drift genetically and
eventually settle into a pattern of annual epidemic recur
rences caused by the drifted virus variants"
1876,when did the first wave of the h1n1 swine flu occur," a ﬁrst or spring wave
began in march 1918 and spread unevenly through the
united states europe and possibly asia over the next 6
months"
1877,what was the death rate in the first wave of the 1918 swine flu pandemic," illness rates were high but death rates
in most locales were not appreciably above normal"
1878,when were the second and the third wave of the 19181919 swine flu pandemic," a sec
ond or fall wave spread globally from september to
november 1918 and was highly fatal in many nations a
third wave occurred in early 1919 "
1879,what was the primary difference between the first wave and the 2nd and 3rd wave of the 19181919 swine flu pandemic,"the much higher fre
quency of complicated severe and fatal cases in the last 2
waves"
1880,why the human influenza viruses do not disappear after herd immunity is developed,"the occurrence and to some extent the severity of recur
rent annual outbreaks are driven by viral antigenic drift
with an antigenic variant virus emerging to become domi
nant"
1881,what are the circumstances that promote the spread of influenza virus," lower environ
mental temperatures and human nasal temperatures bene
ﬁcial to thermolabile viruses such as inﬂuenza optimal
humidity increased crowding indoors and imperfect ven
tilation due to closed windows and suboptimal airﬂow"
1882,do seasonal temperatures and humidity explain the appearance of the three waves of the 1918 swine flu,"such factors cannot explain the 3 pandemic
waves of 19181919 which occurred in the springsum
mer summer—fall and winter of the northern
hemisphere respectively the ﬁrst 2 waves occurred at a
time of year normally unfavorable to inﬂuenza virus
spread the second wave caused simultaneous outbreaks
in the northern and southern hemispheres from
september to november "
1883,which virus samples from the 1918 swine flu pandemic have been identified,"pandemic virus samples we have
yet identiﬁed are from secondwave patients"
1884,are viruses in the first and third waves of the 1918 swine flu pandemic same or derived from the virus from the second wave of the swine flu,"nothing
can yet be said about whether the ﬁrst wave or for
that matter the third wave represented circulation of the
same virus or variants of it"
1885,was the 1918 swine flu virus novel to humans are was it derived from older viruses,"viral sequence data now suggest that the entire 1918
virus was novel to humans in or shortly before 1918 and
that it thus was not a reassortant virus produced from old
existing strains that acquired 1 or more new genes"
1886,do avian flu viruses change over long periods,"inﬂuenza virus gene
sequences from a number ofﬁxed specimens ofwild birds
collected circa 1918 show little difference from avian
viruses isolated today indicating that avian viruses likely
undergo little antigenic change in their natural hosts even
over long periods"
1887,what is the typical age profile of mortality in influenza diseases,"the curve of inﬂuenza deaths by age at death has histor
ically for at least 150 years been ushaped 
exhibiting mortality peaks in the very young and the very
old with a comparatively low frequency of deaths at all
ages in between"
1888,what was the age profile of mortality in the 1918 swine flu,"agespeciﬁc death rates in the
1918 pandemic exhibited a distinct pattern that has not been
documented before or since a “w—shaped” curve similar to
the familiar ushaped curve but with the addition of a third
 distinct peak of deaths in young adults z20410
years of age"
1889,which age group was most susceptible to die during the 1918 swine flu pandemic,"persons 65 years of age in 1918 had a dispro
portionately high inﬂuenza incidence"
1890,what was the death rate among children during the 1918 swine flu pandemic,"those 5 to 14
years of age accounted for a disproportionate number of
inﬂuenza cases but had a much lower death rate from
inﬂuenza and pneumonia than other age groups "
1891,what theory provides partial explanation for the agespecific profile of the death rate in the 1918 swine flu pandemic," the 1918 virus had an intrinsically high virulence tem
pered only in those patients who had been born before
1889 eg because of exposure to a thencirculating virus
capable of providing partial immunoprotection against the
1918 virus strain only in persons old enough to
have been infected during that prior era "
1892,is there a difference in the pathologic feature and course of disease between modern influenza pandemics and the 1918 swine flu pandemic," the 1918
pandemic was different in degree but not in kind from
previous and subsequent pandemics despite the extraordi
nary number of global deaths most inﬂuenza cases in
1918 were
mild and essentially indistinguishable from inﬂuenza cases
today "
1893,could the 1918 swine flu virus been controlled by modern day drugs or vaccines,"the 1918 and 1918like viruses would be
as sensitive as other typical virus strains to the food and
drug administrationiapproved antiinﬂuenza drugs riman
tadine and oseltamivir"
1894,why was there such a high death rate in the 19118 swine flu pandemic,"clinically and pathologically these
high death rates appear to be the result of several factors
including a higher proportion of severe and complicated
infections of the respiratory tract rather than involvement
of organ systems outside the normal range of the inﬂuenza
virus also the deaths were concentrated in an unusually
young age group"
1895,is the molecular basis of human adaptation of a virus understood,"while data bearing
on inﬂuenza virus human cell adaptation eg receptor
binding are beginning to be understood at the molecular
level the basis for viral adaptation to efﬁcient humanto
human spread the chief prerequisite for pandemic emer
gence is unknown for any inﬂuenza virus"
